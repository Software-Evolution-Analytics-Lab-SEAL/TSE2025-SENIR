You can only need name and price.Which path for API development is better?1. Provide to API users full amount of data for processing by themseleves (can be redudant)2.

If I map the function with the process pool execution takes ~75 seconds. So while I don't expect a 15x speed boost I'd expect more than the 4.5x increase I'm getting.

I'm a cybersecurity professional that's recently started a new position as a DevSecOps Engineer consultant where I'll be developing proprietary security solutions for clients. I am by no means a developer by trade so I have and will be learning as I go. I think it's important that I learn development best practices before I get too deep so I don't retain any bad habits I may have from not having a development background. I'm hoping to use this community to learn get advice and eventually contribute where I can from the experience I gain through my work projects. If anyone ever has any questions related to security I would be glad to help if I can! Thanks and I look forward to being part of the community!"
