But when the failureresult isn\\'t used and the value result happens to be exactly equal to the failureresult I do want the value contract to apply to it. How do I distinguish those though?I tried to take inspiration from Carl Eastlund\\'s `dict/c` implemented in `mischief/contract` but it doesn\\'t use chaperones so it is free to both add an escape continuation and change the `failureresult` input to always be a new synthesized procedure. That way the new synthesized failureresult procedure can call the escape continuation. If I\\'m constrained to chaperones I don\\'t know how to do either of those things.How can I detect whether the `failureresult` is usedornot by the dict\\'s implementation of `dictref` while keeping the `failureresult` a chaperone of the original failureresult?I have also asked on the Racket Users list: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racketusers/kHQmJh63mU/8SXYlmZzAAAJ"

One that comes to mind is the Self programming language was implemented with a classless object system (like js) and the implementors proceeded to implement smalltalks class system in self.You may also like the racketcon talk Like a blind squirrel in a ferrari a few years ago or the Why Racket addendum in Beautiful Racket (by Matthew Butterick.)"

A small ball (a black circle of radius 5) is initially located at position (0,150). The ball should now move straight southeast until it hits the bottom edge of the scene. At this time it should bounce off the edge toward the northeast until it hits the right edge of the frame (which will happen at position (300,150)). At this point the ball should turn red and stay at position (300,150) for the rest of the animation (as far as the viewer is concerned this ends the animation).To achieve this define constants for the scene and two samesize balls one black and one red. For the animation you need to define a single function drawball that takes the xcoordinate of the ball (a natural number) as input and draws the ball at the correct position (x,y); you do the math to figure out y. Like pinetree this function returns an image. Remember that for some values of x the ball moves southeast; for others it moves northeast. The origin of the coordinate system is the topleft corner! The color of the ball also depends on x.Once you have defined drawball to start the animation you pass the function name to the animate function: (animate drawball). For this to work your code must include the (require 2htdp/universe) directive (in addition to (require 2htdp/image))."

My only substantial programming experience so far is with _How to Design Programs_ which I am very close to finishing. The book introduces for loops in an intermezzo but otherwise sticks to recursion; and in looking ahead to the contents of the _How to Design Classes_ draft I saw that it contains a section called Why Loops are Bad ... but that was never even started. While I have had no problem with recursion in working through _HtDP_ when I was trying to implement 3SUM based on an algorithms textbook I did think using nested for loops looked easier. Why does there appear to be hostility to for loops in functional contexts?"
