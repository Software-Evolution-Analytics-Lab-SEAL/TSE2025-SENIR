Can someone help me in #helplollipop @BooHemmy The inputs would be 1 2 3 first x would be printed and then it would be incremented so after you call global_func once 1 would be printed and x would now be = 2 @vacuumdecay please use a help channel not asking for help. only for opinions. either way this isn't a small question imo both work but is it worth getting rid of lambda here? yeah i think so I mean people say assigning to lambda is evil why is that. if you are going to assign a name to a lambda you are better off just defining it as a def well I am not assigning a name to it. @sura Thanks for the explanation above!! Now i get it. ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ no ik im just saying that is why people say its evil defining it as a mthod is better what you did is basically assign a name to a lambda I just dont know why people say dont assign to lambda when it simplifies so much my code in this case. Without lambda I have to assign it twice and have a decorator that checks for both names in a dictionary lol Why would you have to assign it twice no I mean yes but raises an error. you can do `var1 = var2 = var3 = 0` integer is not iterable mind that it may produce some unexpected behaviour with mutable objects not at all. > isn't there a way to set multiple variables to the same thing on 1 line?@uwsh > you can do `var1 = var2 = var3 = 0`@dennis @Numerlor The object is immutable once it gets returned. this function is essentially a constructor aLn objects that you can change after they are created so lists dictionaries etc. it leads to this because you're changing the object both of the names point to```pyIn [20]: a = b = []In [21]: a.append(1)In [22]: aOut[22]: [1]In [23]: bOut[23]: [1]``` maybe `a b c = [] [] []` that'd be fine anyone have any recommended Python tutorials that helped them personally?

I am beginner in programming and only thing I know is how to create websites and CSS. I want to create easy program that would take file in folder for example message.txt encrypt it to for example ASCII and put the output to another file for example result.txt"". So the folder will be three things and Python would just take information from one encrypt it and then put the result to the second. Is that possible? yeah completely ```pydef encrypt(string: str) > str: Very bad string encryptor."""""" return str().join(reversed(string))with open(\'message.txt\ \'r\') as file: message = file.read()encrypted = encrypt(message) # encrypt your messagewith open(\'result.txt\ \'w\') as file: file.write(encrypted)``` What does ? Thats a comment? yeah a docstring docstring Oh thanks it works. Can I ask multiple questions so I can actually know what everything does? alright `open(file_path mode)` opens a file What does the mode do? `r` stands for reading `w` for writing Okay `with open(file_path mode) as file` will ensure that the file is closed after operations because unclosed files may cause problems And the with""? Like how it works? I have already sent Okay thanks with calls `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of an object I just found out that I can make characters to ASCII. So when I use the ord() I just delete the reversed and write ord""? ord() returns an integer So I need to convert that integer to string right? chr(ord('a')) is simply a ``__str__`` is what the value of the class will be if you print it right? Or do you have to convert it to a string first? chr(number) is like backwards of ord(character) @Oli `print` converts all arguments to strings so no you donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t have to ``self.__setattr__(""__str__ data[""id""])`` Is this setting the ``__str__`` correctly? Oh I get it. So if I want to convert all the characters in message.txt to ASCII I wil need ord()? why would you do that? is dataid a func? ord() is not really doing ascii That's question for who? also setattr instead of the dunder ^ ? there's a setattr builtin that calls the dunder ? !d setattr None :GWaobloChildPepeCry: sorry im stupid @Deleted User hereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s an example what you can do with encrypting:```pydef encrypt(string: str shift: int = 13) > str: s_1 = ((n + shift) for n in map(ord string)) s_2 = str().join(map(chr s_1)) return str().join(reversed(s_2))``` ```py>>> message = my secret message'>>> encrypt(message)'rtn\\x80\\x80rz\\x81r\\x7fpr\\x80\\x86z'``` Woah what is it encrypting the message to? another string Oh I see What does map() do?

I started learning python a few days ago and I just completed the python crash course from freecodecamp.org. What should i learn next? I mean how do i proceed now? @killcams That sort of problem is almost always caused by installing the requirements to a different instance of Python than the one you're invoking to run the script oh would it be because I have 2 different pythons installed @Deleted User Look for some problems in your life that seem like they are interesting applications of Python as problem solving or automation tool @killcams Almost certainly yes okay so i have 3.8.2 and 3.5.0 which one do i uninstall If one of them is tied to something important then it's unwise to just remove them Which OS are you on? uhh wdym by OS sorry im stupid operating sysem Windows Linux Mac OS etc. ph oh windows OK If you type `py` at the command line that will typically bring up the most recent version of Python using cmd right so you can use that to disambiguate which version you want to install in or use Yes 3.8.2 eg. `py 3.8 m pip list` will bring up Python 3.8 and run `pip` `py 3.8 myscript.py` will launch `myscript.py` using 3.8 How would you get people to use your creations? I feel like I'm programming for no reason since its not being used. @TricolorHen061 Post your work on GitHub or some other codesharing service. Get into a Discord or Reddit community that revolves around the thing you're trying to address wait i think im using 3.5.0 None that shows up @killcams either way you can use `py` to bring up and work with a specific version Use `py 0` to see which versions are installed 3.832 and 3.532 @Infinimata that sounds difficult? i will try @Deleted User Python's a tool it's used to make things easier. Look for something in your own life that's worth making easier or working on Abstract problems aren't as compelling should i uninstall both pythons and just reset everything @killcams As long as you are fairly confident you don't have anything that depends on one that'll be trashed alright okay Also you have the 32bit versions installed; you might want to install the 64bit versions unless you're trying to keep compatibility with some 32bit library but that's exceedingly rare at this point https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python350/ which one Windows x8664 executable installer that's generally the best bet @Deleted User In my case I was having organizational problems with my creative projects so I've been making a personal wiki app that's cool Yeah I posted about it ealier in #memes I only just today made the first public release  it's still very alpha quality oh i will check that out wait wtf that legit fixed everything Huzzah! thanks ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For anything where you are trying to extract information from a complexly formatted string or make changes to it you probably need to use `re` (regular expressions) Yes,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is not _always_ easy but it is fairly straightforward compared to other languages Uh There are two easy ways to fight against that feeling 1) Get a support group that gives you positive reinforcement no matter what.2) Figure out what progress looks like and how fast you are making progress. Make sure you are completing modules in the same amount of time as other people ect ect. It\'s generally a good idea to ask ""How would I tell if someone else isn\'t cut out for x? You develop some metrics find flaws in your metrics fix them then you apply them to yourself and see how you stack up Getting through a chapter a week is pretty good Set small goals. Even though they might be very simplistic resolving them helps relieve that feeling of not making any progress. Goal setting will give you a positive feelings too. I mean people learn different things at different rates too. Cut out for has to have some pass fail criteria Not getting through the same number of chapters as another person as quickly doesn't have to mean that you're not cut out to be a programmer. I suggest addressing this feeling which stems from uncertainty / bad measurements of self worth It actually might IMHO If you are in the bottom 10% of programmers or move 80% slower That might work if it turns out that you are in fact measuring up to other people and you're just mistaken about it. You are fighting a huge uphill battle given programming is sorta competitive anyway I'm not sure what you mean by that. I don't find programming to be competitive at all. Uhhh It's more like it's innately collaborative. I compete with other people for good jobs higher status whatever The job market here is so good that I don't have to compete. There are jobs for people who are way less experienced and talented than me. I think the idea of not being cut out for something is kind of a misconception in itself. Success is probably at least 90% hard work in any case. ....UH that's ..not right If you're frustrated there's bound to be ways you can improve your learning methodology. I mean maybe there are jobs for really crap programmers. But I think there is a space for telling people to packup and go home and do something they would be better at. Of course whoever you are giving advice to can overcome their challenges and succeed I think it's exceedingly unlikely that advice is going to be constructive. But really the argument to pack it up and pack it in applies to best use of time to some metric There's no way you can have enough for information to make that judgment. I think it's very likely the advice is going to be constructive Over discord? Probably not And you can very easily destroy what little confidence someone has by saying something like that. That's not really an objection It's actually a bit of a conjecture . I would be invigorated if someone told me I couldn't do something That's what I mean by it not being constructive. You can't know that it's true and if you use it you're much more likely to harm than help. You are the exception then. That's also conjecture and pretty limited You can give constructive negative feedback just as well as positive feedback Ok let me rephrase. Sure Maybe you're not the exception but you belong to a specific class of people. There's a significant number of other people who do not respond well to being told they are innately unfit for something. It's careless to assume that other people are going to be like you in this regard. What does it mean when something is Lazy? @Hotfix As in lazy evaluation""? It is generated when you need it @Hotfix not respond well carries a lot of baggage / is doing a lot of heavy lifting in your statement @Sinthrill I can elaborate on it but if you'll interpret me charitably I'm sure you can imagine what I mean by it. You're talking about lazy generators introduced in py3 I guess? well in some ways you are right and other ways you are wrong. Ok can we talk some python? :pithink: Agreed. Not being in that class of people you can understand that I wouldn't be naturally predisposed to that pov so I have to make guesses. sure Let's move this to ot if you want to continue offtopic ? ot0 ? Sure So what I was wondering  is there a way to run a shell command without subprocess? Probably but why you don't want to use subprocess? @nekitdev you can use os.system i think popen might be a thing in os as well There is `os.popen` too well as silly as it is I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t have multiprocessing :pensive_snake_cowboy: alright Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll see You don't want to return until the command is terminated? subprocess is the recommended approach though. `os.popen` is deprecated But `os.system` is not `system()` just call the C function `system() ` ```py proc = subprocess.Popen( ... # command here stderr=subprocess.STDOUT stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE cwd=cwd env=env, )``` I am trying to get the same thing as this but without using subprocess :pithink: I don't think you can :roothink: ï¿½ï¿½\\_(ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½)_/ï¿½ï¿½ Maybe you can use `popen` but it is deprecated just checked canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t do that as well haha You can use `os.system` and redirect the output to a file",,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't need it to be pretty or even have a UI it's only meant for me.How would you go about making something like that in python which library would do the trick ? I have no experience whatsoever with android dev. Thanks Kivy is a popular choice for Android apps @halp (+ Buildozer) I would ask in #userinterfaces though it's a very specific topic Thank you for your answer however I've been reading about it and I realize that running a script would be easier/better in my case. Not sure how permissive scripting is on android tho would a shell script allow me to push a notification ? I'm assuming there's a system call for that I'm not sure you could do that unless the phone is rooted and has some modifications I know everything you could usually run in Android (in a regular fashion) is via apps which are isolated I don\'t think you could just run a script unless it\'s being interpreted by some app I was thinking about running the script in termux or something like that oh yeah that could work maybe you would depend on termux's permissions I suppose you could ask for help in the off topic channels if that's what you pursue since it's not really Python related Yea I guess thank you ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I recall seeing services that can forward what you want to android push notifications. Maybe they work with some REST API That way the script can run on a desktop I was just thinking about that some guy probably made a nice scripting app ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Gonna look into that For example https://pushed.co/ They have a REST API you could use with Python Well the app doesn't have great reviews but hopefully you can find something similar That's looks nice just found SL4A Script laucher in the play store SL4A is apparently a python (and other languages) scripting api for android.

Why would they have access to the code that creates the encrypted string in the class instance? ```py def __purge_extraneous_curseforge_cache_data(self): for entry in self.curseforge_cache.values(): entry.__setattr__(f""_{type(entry).__name__}__versions None) entry.__setattr__(f""_{type(entry).__name__}__description None)``` you could implement one yourself pretty easily with:```pythontry: some_string.encode('ascii') is_ascii = Trueexcept UnicodeEncodeError: is_ascii = False``` What do you mean? When I run this code on my conputer it works ```pythonprint(""Hi"".isascii())``` But when I run it on my VPS I get the error None Python 8 3.6.9 @well in that case If he is going to be instantiating these classes the constructor could potentially call an external library/module that would not be exposed to anyone who had an instance of the class. ah yeah thats a pretty big flaw what I said before Using rust or C? what are you trying to accomplish again? would be the cleanest and most reliable in the long run but not practical so can you use 3 colons?like [:::1]?",,,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,,1,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Like to ask a player if they wanna play again. loops are generally better in this case certainly But it does sound like for what you're doing loops will be much better you generally want to avoid recursion in python it does not handle as well as it could Is it likely that Python ever gets better at recursion? Or is it just sort of stuck like this because of the way the language is? I feel like at least tail recursion could be done what complaints do you have? First of all the limit of 1000 is annoying ```python idk = lambda x :[x.append(list(i[1]).sort()) for i in x]print(idk([(0,2),(4,3),(9,9),(10,1)]))``` i want to get the output as 1,2,3,9 you can change that second of all tail recursion is pretty nice but it throws me error .sort() returns None as does .append() and i[1] will be an int I've found most anything I could do with tail recursion I could do more efficiently with a stack (read: a list) This really seems like it belongs in #esotericpython then how to get the ouput without using map function why are you doing this in the first place? @Infinimata having to manage a stack yourself is often just less readable than tail recursion `sorted(j for i,j in x)` Yeah but it means that many less function calls that many less stack frames created and destroyed which are really expensive operations and managing the stack amounts to what pushing and popping elements into and from a list? ye there are ways around tail recursion```pydef tailrec(a b=0 c=0): while True: if cond: a,b,c = a  1 ~b c else: return a + b```this is a neat way Yeah. I'm not saying its terrible at the moment just it'd be nice if Python was happier with tail recursion. If it could optimise more of the overhead away I do doubt it can do C level of recursion optimalization though I don't understand either Python or tail recursion enough for too much detail in this discussion tho I think there's a discussion GvR had at one point about why it's not a good fit What is `~b`? also GvR? Guido van Rossum Python's creator oh guido yeah I misread it. Thought GvR was a book or something binary inverse `__invert__` i1 on ints no real meaning here there were a few reasons he gave but one was that it obfuscates stack traces another is that if it's tail recursive you can do it with normal iteration huh just realized davidism hangs out in here. small world depends on who you ask. If you ask me the answer is yes if they have no reason to be nested it's usually better to have them separate imo I'll have `d.update( x = <something>)` where ` x \\in {'a b c'}` and i want to have this dictionary with keys `'a b c'` it can take both a dict an kwargs thank you @lakmatiol oh nevermind that is weird",,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Simple we know that bit. But what is actually happening when we do? mhm We can look at it another way instead of `billy.introduce()` We can think of it as `Student.introduce(billy)` Yes `self` refers to the class instance that is being called instance? That is where I get confused An instance is an object of the class.

Nowdays that GDNative is decent I'd be using Rust through GDNative. however Godot is pretty meh in general and too slow in development for me to really want to adopt it. I stick with Unity for 2D UE4 for 3D and Amethyst (A Rust framework) for any project that requires some more fine tuning GDScript the native language for the Godot game engine. it looks like they've changed it quite a lot now it's far different than it used to be almost looks like a mixture of cython and rust with dynamic typing still there GDNative = ? OH lmao He means GDScript or GodotScript. no I don't ? GDScript is the pythonesque programing language.GDNative is a module for Godot that allows you to load shared libraries built with any other programming language Oh Essentially you can use whatever language you want to program in Godot through the use of GDnative so long as you can access the C API. https://godotengine.org/article/dlscripthere Alright. So you can in theory use Python in Godot but that would be a stretch I'll drop farther thoughts in #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor I mean GDscript i think its called is basically already python Syntax wise Personally I use Unity because I prefer C#'s syntax Python's strength is in its libraries imo Godot has C# support but from what I've heard it's not as well documented as GDScript Hi Just run the code,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A wrapper is a wrapper  it's something wrapped around the original code in this case it\'s a Python front end for the C back end @Hackysack #helpchestnut if u r able to access it okay thanks @Infinimata makes sense From the python perspective those wrappers are libraries same as stuff like random or Datetime.

I know of it but I don't really understand the question  it's a different library that serves a similar purpose to curses; why the need to mix and match? essentially id liek to use the markup code/coloring and layout support it offers but those are escape hacks it uses..which like i said curses doesnt allow a raw print through (from what i can tell anyhow) i may be completely wrong maybe a switch im missing to find somewhere what's your code look like so far? haha just bits and pieces to prove out an idea maybe ill just stick to curses colors and wrap a rich like api of my own for just what im looking for its really only colors i ran into wall with perhaps the other stuff works dunno i tried printing and they all the same id like to know what would be the proper way to track all instances of a class is this it? the `instance_dict` thing,,,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's also a point of curiosity on my part looking to understand different ways of doing the same thing ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Yeah. Lambdas are definitely worth learning about even if you shouldn't use them most of the time Is it a good idea to use lambda in tkinter to call a wrapper to another function?

Add to API more functions to provide users exact amount of data what they need (without fanatism) @Shirayuki you need to be careful about what values you use as keys for your dictionary access test Pretty sure in python's hashing function it maps low integers straight to themselvesIt does so exactly so it can speed up the common case that low integers would be keys in many dictionaries So the exactly equal access times make sense Try setting strings as keys,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks looking into it rn @Deleted User Nvm you guys just discussed this right before I came Mbmbmbb Where did u learn? @Not Great Nah don't ask me that I think my approach was horrible Lol I just took concepts put them on a list and studied each one at a time For example variables That doesnt seem bad I think thats a great idea Not Great Im doing JetBrain's course rn I would go on YouTube Google any website and literally have 10 tabs opened for one concept Thats actually good Cuz you get different definitions and details from different sources Yes but quite messy not everyone can keep ip this way It's still better to follow one single course id say if you have any experience in other languages you should have some idea of what each projects is going to entail.. personally ive been choosing projects i know I can figure out with only learning very few new concepts And if there's a concept you don't fully understand from that course then you go for Google hello > if you have any experience in other languages you should have some idea of what each projects is going to entail.. personally ive been choosing projects i know I can figure out with only learning very few new concepts@wordsun but before I move on to another language I really wanna make one big dick project with python that's why I'm asking for recommendations im new here and new to python as well can u guys tell me where should i start to learn python? https://pythondiscord.com/pages/resources/https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html @Not Great I see what you mean If you feel comfortable enough learning new stuff id bite off a project that will require the use of a library you havent used or some functions you know you arnt super familiar with.. that way you can be improving with the project. If you want to just flex with what you already know you would have to come up with an idea that fits within that @Moderation Team I got a dm ad You can send any reports by DMing @Python Discord ModMail ok Are there any issues with namedtuples in python 3.9?

On the job I was required to write a simple parser to parse the results of unit testing into a html file And I chose Python is python hard to learn No they say it's one of the most beginner friendly language Along with Go I think I want to make games but its hard for me to learn cpp and c# now and wanted to start with something more simple There is a whole lib dedicated to making games with Python  Pygame Maybe looking into it? Arcade exists as well It's actually the main thing that'll be used for the upcoming Game Jam Protips: Never register github with your real name and dob Idk why I did it. Now I feel stupid lmao anything with an event loop can be a good way to make games @hot9cups I can't share my stuffs without feeling like I'm exposing my info oh you mean like on platforms like discord I think you can go into the settings and change the username @Deleted User That's why I am afraid lol.

Any help will be wonderful... and sorry if i mistaken in the right channel Ah okay @dennis . The idea has some allure but I could see some big issues with practicality and reliability. @Soku what omrusman said is one option depending on how your program runs. There are others as well. @tristan #ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½howtogethelp thx @TheKing oki thx maybe if you have a nested loop```pyfinal = []for i in List: for j in i: final.append(j)``` So I know that ``sys.path.append(filePath)`` will put a file on your path.But how do you get stuff on your path if you are going to share the program? dang convenient lemme write some code real quick to show you what I was explaining is it to turn a nested list into a regular list? nah he/she is extracting elements from a nested list and giving them levels > maybe if you have a nested loop> ```py> final = []> for i in List:> for j in i:> final.append(j)> ```but this looks like it turns it into a regular list I was thinking maybe he should make a dict initialize a counter then use i as a key value yep my nestedlist are nary tree representation. The idea is to access elements,i.e nodes by level. ```pyIn [5]: for i in List:  ...: counter +=1  ...: for j in i:  ...: final[counter]=j  ...: In [6]: final Out[6]: {1: 3 2: 6 3: 9}In [7]: ``` wait do you have an example of the list is it like this `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` it s irregular nested list like: testcase=['a','b',['c','d','e'],'f',['g',['h','j'],'k'],'l'] ... so level1 would return a,b,f,l and so on I think I've got something ```In [9]: for i in List:  ...: print(i)  ...: ab['c d e']f['g ['h j'] k']l``` then you could probably use some text formatting to strip everything that looks like a list level one would then be the non stripped text I like fruit anyone else like fruit? yep like repr for exampleand use opening and closing brackets as level triggers... but it means transform data. @Yerum ALT yep me too ahahah ```pyIn [16]: print([i for i in List if len(i)==1]) ['a b f l']In [17]: ``` the logic is pretty brain :duckyangel: ing ahahaah cool but sorry my exemple was a proxy of the real data that are nested lists of string so it will be more ['amonia','zinc',['or','silver',['potassium','oxygen']],'mana','sprite'] i tried sthg like this but it needs to be recursive: \'\'\'current = 0maxD = 0level0=[]level1=[]level2=[]level3=[]for ix,char in enumerate(repr(nestedList)): if current == 0 and char !=""[ and char !=""] and char != : level0.append(char) if current == 1 and char !=""[ and char !=""] and char != :  level1.append(char) if current == 2 and char !=""[ and char !=""] and char != :  level2.append(char) if current == 3 and char !=""[ and char !=""] and char != :  level3.append(char)  if char == [ and ix != 0: current += 1 if current > maxD: maxD = current  elif char == ] and ix != len(nestedList)1: current = 1level0=\'\'.join(level0)level1=\'\'.join(level1)level2=\'\'.join(level2)level3=\'\'.join(level3)\'\'\ @pearpineapple yes it s the ugliest one i ever wrote... i t s testing time ^^ pliz don't discourage me :_) hehe hope not @Crimson Interesting will look into DOD.

Try to go on github look at the simplest keras/tensorflow projects you can and rewrite them in your own way. right i just felt that things were clicking up until where i am now and the libraries/modules are just so complex yeah that's a good idea actually @?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ ?ï¿½ Blaze_ ty for the rec np @ChillFish8 atm I am working with Quart 3.8 is relatively new so most libraries haven't been updated to support it yet But it works in the video... waiti just typed print(Fore.YELLOW)and it gave me olive color It was Jose Portilla's bootcamp.

(I'm using PyCharm) Yes Hmm What python version are you using? 3.8.3 if your on pycharm you can hover over what your importing and itll give you an option to install the package otherwise you can pip it in the console and theres a package manager in the settigns somewhere too try from tkinter import  and that should work as default since that was set default for me without needing any packages If your missing it then install it @wordsun  not so lucky for me Try what I said @Djdude02  that worked. Why did i have to import it that way? don't do that Why not? Just curious ```pythonimport tkinter #Goodfrom tkinter import <specific classes> #Goodfrom tkinter import  #BAD``` Well you are importing everything Is that the reason why? what pip command would I use to download tkinter so i can use ```import tkinter``` Rather import the classes you need than import the whole thing? no tkinter classes will override any default names import tkinter puts it in own namespace Agh if you want it all ```import tkinter``` so everything will be tkinter.<whatever> i had to use ```import tkinter as tk``` if you wanted to short it you could do ```pythonimport tkinter as tk``` ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ so everything becomes tk.<whatever> you don't HAVE to use as tk Go to cmd and do pip install tkinter I beleive Oh I see. I was trying with a capital ```T``` unless library is that messed up which I doubt tkinter is i read it is standard with python on windows if you install 3.X or above you can uncheck it Hmm whats preferred in networking? Scapy or sockets or other? web sockets no seriously websockets are pretty cool if overhead of them are not too much intelliJ has scenebuilder  does pycharm have an equivelant? isnt web sockets for wesbites only? nope discord bots use websocket for incoming from Discord if your doing pip installs remember that doing it in cmd will do it globally to your python install on windows where as doing it inside the env in pycharm it will be just for that project yes the transport is HTTP but you don't require a browser on client end bonus points is lack of worrying about firewalls hi I was thinking of using scapy scapy is more for messing with packets socket is more for moving data around @60x just the channel we use it in and that didn't really require a mods ping ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ next time that can go in #communitymeta,,,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,,1,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I already made an project with django can i install virtualenv now? or would it harm my project or something? I got a question...which python version supports discord libraries? @Deleted User If you installed django already and then add a venv in your project odds are the venv will simply inherit all the alreadyinstalled libraries including Django I'm about to download it..but there are so many versions @Deleted User 3.7 is your safe bet ok wdym by that serdar what about the latest version 3.8.2? so its fine for me to install one? @Deleted User When you create a venv it will transparently use any libraries installed in the underlying Python installation I want to create a bot using python so i should be fine then @Deleted User 3.8 has issues with connecting the bot correctly it throws an error most of the time. alright @dudaskule no? discord.py works fine with 3.8.x ... @ChillFish8 Depends on your operating system. how? Trying to set up a db using SQLite3 following a video received a Syntax error despite doing theoretically exactly what he did Sometimes it does work sometimes it doesn't 3.6 or 3.7 are your best options for discord bot development. @Baron X check that trailing comma in your SQL statement ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ i have yet to see an issue with discord.py that is OS specific you rock serdar 3.6.0 has has an issue syntax god ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ SQL is normally quite fussy about such things which version 3.7.7 or 3.7.6? 3.7.7 I'd say basically any py version that isnt: `3.7.0 3.6.0` is fine for discord.py ok..thank you so much as long as its 3.6+ What? Discord.py supports 3.5.3 and upwards hmm yh ig it does i stand corrected 3.5 will reach EOL soon i think they were saying at one point in the future 3.6 will become in lowest version requirement better to be safe than sorry which version @Infinimata ? what os... Windows take the windows exe ok Chose the last one with a description also i would recommend learning the basics of python before jumping into discord.py Which loss function is suitable for ml model of image detection ? What exactly makes something a scripting language? That's a very hard to answer question It is better to learn python basics before using discord.py it can be really confusing? Do you know any other programming language? @Deleted User Being interpreted is a good start You don't have to compile something to an executable before you run it You can just write a script and run that (Technically Python is compiled but don't worry about it) sorta xD on a side note when using docker and python specifying `python:3` is docker just going to take py folder that is at the top of PATH? guys i need some advice on my project im making some program that converts text into number bases or another kind of numeric stuff but the problem is anything more than base 2 is a problem you see for a 0; i'm going to make the program output a high frequency sound for a 1; i'm going to make the program output a low frequency sound (more hearable) but the problem here is the decimal system and hexadecimal system have too many variations None 0123456789ABCDEF in hexadecimal a total of 16 different numbers(??) and 1234567890 in decimal a total of 10 numbers 16 if you count `0` for the hexadecimal one. i think i shouldn't have posted this here So you wan't to output a sound based on the number value if I understand this correctly? no... @dudaskule I'm totally new to the programming language...but in the past I learn about the basics of C language but I don't remember it now I'm a Civil Engineer but I have interest in programming stuffs also It would be good then to take a look into some basic python programs string manipulation defining functions working with classes getting to know the keywords. @Deleted User @Deleted User Windows x8664 installer (web or full doesn't matter) And when you install make sure you check the option to add Python to your system path,,,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,,0,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Falsey objects cause bool(x) to return False But they themselves are not False @gdude You mean all Falsey objects are not False just Falsey? Yeah In the sense that they are not literally booleans. Yes I didn;t even come across word Falsey in Python Language Reference I and I read all of it Well I'm pretty sure it is in there It's not a language specific thing But it's a common term any link to Python docs or PIP on this? um this is kind of a stupid question but how do i run my python script in vs 2019? Everything is truthy except for NaN False 0 None empty containers/strings or classes that override `__bool__` to return False @Arnuld https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truthvaluetesting Seems like Truthy and Falsey are probably not official terms in the Python docs but they are commonly used. ? you are correct on that None Well now you know. @Johnny Wobble you might want to read this https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimalreproducibleexample class bool([x])  Changed in version 3.7: x is now a positionalonly parameter. what's positional only?

Just because a symbol means one thing in one places does not mean it means that in all places @Charlie That is very weird @Arnuld foo(bar=1 baz=2) or foo(baz=2 bar=1) for example. yes If an argument is positionalonly that means you can\'t provide it as a named parameter. So I'm assuming the problem is with that library You have to do foo(1 2) and rely on the position of the parameter to specify which parameter it is. oh ok.. got it Thanks ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I setup all my other computers to use Python and had no troubles Today I am messang with this one and it just doesn't want to behave When I have a utility installed using pip shouldn\'t I be able to run it from the command line by its name rather than python m somename""?

It's not in a state that I feel #memes would be a good fit for but I would like review on style and optimization before I expand. @JasonS probably not that good an idea the Python standard library isn't meant to be readable (relatively speaking) please can someone help me? What's a typical result for speed increase via multiprocessing? I am running a function using `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` with 15 workers on my 16 thread CPU. When I run the function 50 times in a single thread it takes ~330 seconds. If I map the function with the process pool execution takes ~75 seconds. So while I don't expect a 15x speed boost I'd expect more than the 4.5x increase I'm getting. Is that out of line to the point where there's probably an issue with my code or is this normal? alright @gm  how about one of the external libraries like numpy @JasonS this is a good tutorial for classes and OOP: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc or lxml @sposker it really depends on the nature of your task. no definitely not `numpy` anything that deals with C is not a good idea IMO like for example if your task requires sending a ton of data between processes then that contributes a lot to the overhead @JasonS are you just starting out with OOP? well it's basically just a curiosity timing a function with various inputs. I don't actually need to do this as part of my code it should involve sending 0 data besides the confirmation that the process has completed since I don't care about what it is actually doing. I wouldn't say starting out I have been playing around with it for a few months but do want to look at some more advanced stuff if I wanted speed I'd rework my code to use numpy probably but it doesn't really matter. Was just surprised by the minimal difference between the single threaded and multithreaded runtimes actually now that I reflect on it a bit I'm pretty sure it's being caused by the CPU architecture/ limited cache size making some of the processes use RAM rather than the L1/L2 cache. So this result is fine most likely how advanced is advanced? @sposker One sec okay TBH I have never looked at code to learn specifically when I poke into the source code of libraries it's often as a focused enquiry @sposker For multiprocessing I recently used `Pool` and `imap_unordered` with a fairly large `chunksize` parameter The chunk size definitely affects the performance. `if not 1 == 2 or s in s'` will python even bother checking the second conditional if the first part was false? it won't check sorry it will sweet so I can optimize it just by reordering wow I'm just reading through easygui library I think you mean `and` for that case it isn't too bad with pycharm with `and` it won't check oh `or` will check the second if the first evaluates to `False` hmm figure I can check for best practices > ```python> if 1 == 1 or totes_nonexistent_variable: ... pass > ``` and how they handle errors you can do ths even though whatever is in the second half is not defined as long as it's syntactically correct your code will run @JasonS well there are multiple ways to do things despite what `import this` might tell you @ some point it comes down to style and consistency yeah I confused myself actually. Both `and` and `or` may skip the second check depending on the result of the first. `or` skips if the first statement evaluates to `True` whereas `and` skips if the first statement evaluates to `False` yup this is termed shortcircuit evaluation it's neat but I think it makes code harder to understand so I avoid it I agree @gm but it is a good guide for perspective if you prefer to write in a more functional style (I do) then using stuff like `and` and `or` as operators is more common but it is also true that some people find that a lot less readable which is reasonable Anyone else able to give their thoughts? https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/291284109232308226/662842497499922442 is there anyway while in a loop to say immeidiatly start the next loop kinda like break but only for that one loop? Yeah that does make sense actually. I guess it's just drawing a conclusion based on the result of the first and then immediately using that conclusion in the same line violates the zen of python. My take is that you express one idea or sentence per line of code though depending on the complexity of the idea you might be able to sneak in a little more. But in general I value readability over being concise there's certainly nothing you can only do with clever use of those operators that you can't do in a few more lines Wdym @Jason_Bjorn `continue` @Jason_Bjorn you'll proceed to the next iteration of the loop Oh Thank you kind sir I think it depends on what you consider an idea too No one wants to see my idea TwT sorry @Hitoshi Shinsou|?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½  I just don't understand the idea you are proposing nothing personal Want me to explain it? If you tell me what you don't understand I can explain @Jason_Bjorn both give the same result but the second one would be considered the correct way to write it I took a look at your suggestion @Hitoshi Shinsou|?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ and the issue is basically that you'd be opening yourself up to exploits.

It is but that's not that usual. It's just a regular function (method). Bye Typically if you have logic that you want to call again later you factor that out to a helper method i saw that someone posted like python projects picture that u can do somewhere here does anyone have it? There's one in the pins how would I go on creating a helper method? this channel? also why the cooldown? i dont see a need for such long cooldown We had a bit of a rush and troll hour an hour ago i see @Deleted User I think the problem is the image lol opencv works flawlessly for me @flare98 A helper method is just another method you define and call later hey guys there isn't really a channel for code editor help so I'm gonna ask here We have #toolsanddevops but it's probably fine here oh okay! I\'m using VSCode and whenever I do ctrl + s to save it changes all my code to look better like replacing single quotes with double etc. I'm working on a bigger project so I don't want to change things they already did I had prettier installed but I disabled it but it still keeps cleaning my code How can I disable reformating my code? pretty sure that's a vscode issue and not python @discorduserrr I tried using ``` location.__init__(self) ``` and it gave me ```TypeError: super(type obj): obj must be an instance or subtype of type``` how do u suggest to reformat the code for it to be executed? idk I use pycharm it's amazing auto saves @Deleted User dont think so think you'd have to do everything manually so i can't do dpkg i for an installation to put in in PATH directly. I need to extract the archive first then move the files to path why python doesn't have brackets :( but the project also has js so would I do the python parts on pycharm and js on vscode? pretty sure pycharm can run java well both are editors on vs code install some python plugins to work better with python if you're planning to use that @flare98 Can you share more of your code?

I'm just not sure if they will drop support of python2 when python3 support becomes available. ok But I agree that it's not a good idea to drop python2 the moment python3 becomes available.

You sent many links here nobody's going to spend an hour or more doing research for you @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa That's quite a lot of vertical space and I think you already spend hours having two conversations about resources in this channel. No one here is going to vet the resources just for you. Then which resource should I open and start with? Any suggestions of any 1 awesome one? @Sebastiaan !resources has some good links None Which one did you start learning by? There is no way someone can tell you what resource will work for you  just try em Also are we really doing this again? he hasn't learned about `break` yet so he's stuck in an infinite loop asking about learning resources You really eliminated my option of Youtube since you said one comment means the video sucks @AranFey Don't blame them for your indecisiveness haha Wait you havenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t started learning yet? I have started learning but all resources are somewhat incomplete. I want to know where all you successful people started learning from From an incomplete resource. I'm gonna tell you something you really won't like: I started writing code without having any idea what I was doing there are many websites and apps We're not having this conversation again @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa Pick a resource try it if you don't like it try something else But which resource did you start with personally? We're not having this conversation again. If you wanna learn get started. If you don't.. Why are you here? Haha ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the resource u choose isnt going to matter its how youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re gonna learn it do you want to learn python? @Sebastiaan Just fyi you did not tell me what resources you started with Oh god I don't care. You've asked enough people. this is hopeless AranFey didn't you say that one bad youtube comment means video sucks? @AranFey Why are you looking for people to blame? !tempmute 679278430855888916 1week Apparently your previous mute wasn't clear enough. :incoming_envelope: :ok_hand: applied mute to @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa until 20200312 09:12 (6 days and 23 hours). _(I swear Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m gonna open a PR for this 6 days and 23 hours)_ Is it actually an hour of difference here or is it a minute rounded? It is a 1 second problem It's truncated to two units Ah But the function make it looks like 1h Would an embed be too noisy?

Use your task manager is there a shell command to terminate all tasks with a given name? these are processes spawned with no CLI @Toku are all tasks named differently? `taskkill /IM python.exe` for example lol if I knew that I wouldnt do it Stop all the proceses by the task manager if the processes are misbehaving/stuck you'd have to force kill them as well `taskkill /F /IM python.exe` i had a similar situation lol Ill try that jupyter kept spawning more processes so i just task manager them its caused by fork i think when you download two programs but they are a lot into them: yeah I am using jupyter to spawn ML worker threads it worked thanks @MidZik dont use the threading module use multiprocess np now Ijust need to macro it to my keyboard i wanted to use more cores but ended up in threading which is a giant problem for me lel guys does anyone know how to use matlab here? bhai matlab this is a `python` server yes even if i did i would just octave nilanjan u do? why use octave? cuz octave doesnt charge you 5000usd per year Ohh like that octave is just matlab without the software GUI and charges same thing ohh aight and i did all my math things in python so if your not into octave use python it took several times longer to code but it worth lel ugh well I can kill the processes but it kills the notebook server and it wont restart you killed the wrong process when I call .fit() in scikitlearn it spawns a bunch of worker threads but doesnt destroy them when it's done there is one main process and several slaves i think it might be a problem specific to jupyter yeah VSC has like 5 seperate instances of python to run the env I just checked in processexplorer you can find the main process there None None when running the fit function it spawns this process and wont clean it up so I need to remove it manually I finally finished the <Python> workshop at packt and got my authentication certificate actually it spawns some processess out of the VSC process tree too : / was it hard @April McBroom It was a lot of work the Workshops have you programming for each excercise and every chapter which is good from beginner to advance like pb and Random Trees Its nice because they dont skip the lessons so u can literally start from scratch and understand 95% of everything Nothing its free for a year before July 31st damn more useful than my teacher rn https://courses.packtpub.com/pages/free thanks bro For a year But it took me a month and two weeks to finish ohh damn I thought it would take longer That's because I was programming everyday for 5+ or more hours The ebook was 600+ pages but they took it down Now its just the online book nice How would you rate there way of teaching?

The problem is I want to create an rounded image that I put on an image but I keep getting thisIt is getting on the image but it\'s how could I say too transparent it should be transparent to the image it is getting pasted on.This is the code: ```py async with self.bot.session.get(str(ctx.author.avatar_url_as(format=\'png\'))) as response: response = BytesIO(await response.read()) response = Image.open(response) response = response.resize(size=(200 200)) bigsize = (response.size[0]  3 response.size[1]  3) mask = Image.new(\'L\ bigsize) draw = ImageDraw.Draw(mask) draw.ellipse(xy=(0 0) + bigsize fill=255) mask = mask.resize(response.size Image.ANTIALIAS) response.putalpha(mask) image.paste(response)``` @dennis is here a channel related to image manipluation? hm simple question that doesn't really warrant occupying a help channel; what would this mean: `r['int']` or `r['hex']`? Specifically what does the `r` do? there are more than two help channels don't worry about occupying them lol @void it's hard to tell without more context but `r` is probably a dictionary with `'int'` and `'hex'` being used as keys for it The act of doing `['int']` is you try to call `__getitem__()` with `'int'` as the key out of object r Depending on what `r` is like Serdar said it can do something like returning the value associated with this key if it's a dict or maybe doing something else entirely To make sure you can do ```pyprint(type(r))```to see what type `r` is to make sure other than that it is very hard to tell what it will do I'd go with Serdar's guess that it's a dictionary and in that case you are getting values from the keys you put into it which makes sense now thank y'all y'walcum `r` is definitely shorthand for _response_ is that convention? ah okay python is so gangsta How so? its just vibin yanno like look at java and c and stuff super boring nerdy stuff but along comes python What a headache. All that work for 2 more puzzles solved. i just love shidding and farding all over my keyboard and the code still works thanks python @Deleted User this seems more suited to the offtopic channels oh why its python discussion @Deleted User we try to keep this channel free for actual questions oh okay would using `str().find('zzz')` find something like `pasas.zzz` or would it only find things such as `zzz`? @well in that case why not try it and find out? I did try it im asking to gage if i used it right I don't follow. `find` would find any substring what's `pasas`? example name of what? its arbitrary no it could be a variable name or it could be a generic string for example yikes you must be fun at parties or we want to be specific to answer you properly i had trouble explaining my question you want me to rephrase? that's alright but there's no need to be hostile when i go into my files and go into my pycharm projects and try running something like my rock paper scissors game it does work but once i type which one i picked and the computer picks its option the tab closes you mean pasdas i\'m guessing which would mean a string containing pasdas whereas if i did `pasdas = 1` i've got a variable representing 1 just so you're aware why we need to be careful say pasas is just a instance class zzz being an attr @well in that case why are you using str().find()? and not str.find()? it looks like they are learning the basics still? is that right? yeah im a few weeks into python is 1 falsy btw? the easiest way you test that is with a condition im asking if 1 is falsy since I was checking the condition with truthy falsy if 1 isnt falsy that'd break my goal ```py>>> bool(1)True``` alr You'd think that anything <= 0 would be False. The more you know. that's why it's worth checking the truthiness yeah the negative negates that. forgot about that one Quick question  what U means when doing pip install discord.py? Google and inbuilt help does not mention it. it's short for `user` on mac/linux you should always user that option so you don't install under root Hm weird that it's not default main language is a bit of a strange concept because you should be picking the right tool for the job at hand if you're learning programming in school or whatever then python is likely to be your first language so in that sense it could be seen as the main language there will therefore be people that don't need to use anything other than python as well as those that do what do you mean by handling? i'm still not seeing a question if you have 100 unique invoice numbers you would have 100 invoices @Juicy Pandumpster I'm not sure I understand the question either,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Can you show the format of your CSV file and how exactly you're parsing it @bigmoneyhere ? nvm figured it out i guess my only question would be difference between a np array and a pd array @?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½  windows services can call APIs just fine; I don't understand the question. #botcommands @?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ An OS API call being asynchronous should not prevent it from working in general. But it may be working in a different way than you\'re expecting. Notably asynchronous or nonblocking operations typically work by sending a request to perform some action that gets executed in the background when it\'s able to rather than a synchronous/blocking operation that will fully complete before it returns or executes any other code. im calling a function from ctypes and its not working You're going to have to be much more specific then not crashing just nothing at all ctypes.windll.user32.LockWorkStation() the function works perfectly normal in a normal script Is there a better design pattern for overloading class constructors than just having a bunch of kwargs? I'm getting bogged down by doing data validation when I'd rather have 56 unique constructor methods I.e. having kwargs 14 and having to check is kwarg 1 and 3 are not none but 2 and 4 are then do this and so on I've thought of having separate functions outside of __init__ that just call init and return the constructed class instance @?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ I'm not well versed in the win32 API (as I'm primarily on Linux) but the next thing I would try is running it via `subproess.run()` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html?highlight=subprocess#subprocess.run) and seeing if you get any different behavior. Also some form of logging would likely help to see just before it gets called and after. I have logging after and it logs all fine ok ill try that @Carboxyl > I\'ve thought of having separate functions outside of init that just call init and return the constructed class instanceYep that\'s a fairly common design pattern in libraries. It\'s typically referred to as a factory method Perhaps the service is running as a user that doesn't have privileges to lock the screen.

It's easy to slowly find yourself with a single class that has far too large of a scope. I thought about that! I've tried to dance around the details of what I'm doing to avoid boring everyone with chemistry but I'm implementing a library that calculates an equation of state so all I'm doing is checking if we have have a specified overspecified or underspecified set of equations then doing calculations to fill in the missing blanks. Once those are done the underlying class is always the same Ah I think I understand the gist of it. The core functionality is the same but there are many potential paths to get to the end result based on the specific inputs (or lack of inputs) provided. That seems like it makes sense to have as a single class. if this is wrong area ill delete @Deleted User sounds like API wants a uuid not a name. you need to check the documentation for that resource (URL) you are using couldnt find any for the api how often are keyword arguments used?

And did you remember anything you'd learn the first few days A lot of it is picking out a project and just learning whatever you need. Of course pick out a project that isn't too complicated My first one was a command line 4 function calculator How long did it take for you to get the basics down And your calculator was just a bunch of if and elif? Some command parsing as well I don't really recall how long it took to become confident but the documentation was super helpful. Could you give an estimate please I feel better and confident when I compare myself to others lol It's just my personality Just reading through it is helpful because you can get an idea for what you can do even if you don't remember exactly how to do it you know that it's possible and then you can look up it. I want to say I was coding for a month or two before I started moving away from relying on stackoverflow and stuff so much But I was working on it kinda off and on so that's probably not the most accurate estimate Oh okay thanks What did you do for two months Watch videos? Etc I used the built in docs a lot stackoverflow checked out a few books from my library to use as reference Oh ok > How long did it take you guys to be decent at python and be able to do projects?> And did you remember anything you'd learn the first few daysmy story was the same as a lot of other people's  python was my... third I think language after some kind of BASIC in middle school and Java in high so learning python was learning the specifics of it not programming in general I had coded in drag and drop stuff before so I had a similar situation I knew the thought processes behind writing computer code I just had to learn to use python's syntax.

Please use the #botcommands channel instead. ?ï¿½ï¿½ Actually that one seems to have everything thought it did not have `__bytes__` but I misremembered guess the original docs are always going to be ahead haha Actually no `__debug__` which makes sense it is not part of the data model and also the only constant in python it also won't document dunders from stdlib modules that use them for their own stuff but it should have the most with actual explanations the xpath is correct I am like 90 percent sure @Crimson I hope this helps http://zetcode.com/python/magicmethods/ If you want to have nice looking gui's you should look into PyQt",,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You do not need to catch it because you are explicitly choosing what you want it to be. I'm not sure what you're trying to do. Can you give a little more background on your use case? Like do you want to send someone to a different page based on the classification of their account or something? my example is similar to blog sites but some view are protectect with login  but I dont want to redirect to a static view okay so then include an else statement and send them somewhere else. This is the dispatch method we're talking about right? `else` ? yes Well you have an if statement include an else with another path if they don't authenticate Does that make sense? settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL is just a string with the url of the login page ```if request.user.is_authenticated: pass #return HttpResponseRedirect(settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL) else: print(request.GET['next'])``` `print(request.GET['next'])` this makes `django.utils.datastructures.MultiValueDictKeyError: next'` why are you passing? And why are you printing? to check out if exist next Just return another HttpReponseRedirect object with another url passed into the constructor. HttpResponseRedirect(request.GET['next']) ? I don't understand why you want to capture anything. Just tell it the url you want to go to. the issue is what I have many many protected sites so uri isnt an option too much hardcoded settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL is just a url. Pick a different one for the else statement that isn't protected. It's not that hard. send them back to the login page example. I want to redirect dynamially instead of `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` then include conditionals I think you're overcomplicating things. if / elif / elif / elif ... / else You can chain as many as you want. You'll need a url parameter if you're going to send them to a url that is specific to that user. Do you want it to actually generate a new url every time a user logs in? yeah https://github.com/Acryptarch/RedditPoemGenerator Can someone here test my module out? It would be really nice to have some feedback basically /site/2  /blog/2 /blog/3> then include conditionals@sciencecompliance So the number is the primary key of the user or something like that? Super simple question:How do you make a function be able to take in 2 parameters?For example I have```set(nums val)```and I am calling it with```set(nums 3)```but I keep getting the error that it expects at most 1 argument ```pydef f(x y): ...``` Is this function inside a class @RogueArt ? And are you calling it with the dot operator on an object? `set` is also a datatype in python. i would choose a different name... yeah i realized i made a typo in calling it lmao Good point. Reserved word yeah i also changed set to setval just to be safe all good. i've named plenty of variables `list`. ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ It's so tempting to do. it is. especially during throwaways. because it's the best generic name for the variable which is exactly why it's the reserved word.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is there any difference between these? Haha is it? Do you have a link to the source? whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s code server? is pycharm better than notepad++? yea well subjectively personally just use vs code for everything what is vs code visual studio code ooh how come you use vs code in a browser instead of just vs code itself? VS is .net only or at least very much geared towards it it even has a start windows server button like good tutorials? did you learn the basics first? How does python actually know when an import is above the top package and when it isnt? _and now with arm support_ did you make any projects before? thanks! why would anyone use that on an arm machine lol I do.. Rpi are ARM devices oh? oh Haha that makes more sense then there's ARM servers too Yes but no Haha well there are iirc facebook have a lot of ARM servers low power cheap pretty effective etc Incompatible with most softwares etc depends on the goal. if you're hosting a massive amount of things and are building your own data centres I guess it is fine for facebook since they run probably only their software if its your server and you're writing everything running on it the architecture isn't an issue if you were just running a web server hosting some basic stuff you could probably use an arm unit for low power sometimes you don't need an x8664 beast until you realize the library you're using have only x86 binaries From my experience with my rpi arm is a really bad choice actually idk how python modules work but some node modules come with compiled files which rpi? Only to be able to run the pydis website which isn't really complicated to setup I had an incredible hard time 4b python's importing does feel bit weird honestly tbh @Akarys i was thinking more from a general hosting point of view rather than running code Yeah sure I can understand why bug techs companies uses arm but for an individual it doesn't make sense to me it is a little odd at first but you get used to it relative importing is just some magic really I swear I had issue some time ago with not being allowed to import files from above of x file without adding `sys.path.append(\'../\')` can someone help me in #helpcoconut But now seems like python is alright with just `from file import x` need fast help is there a way to make a function that creates an instance of an object with a unique name? Like for class Car have a function to create a blank object with a simple name appendix? Car1 then car 2 etc? it's probably because of directly running the file vs importing it that file was never ran by itself It pretty much relies on import from parent file @Entropytouch Objects don't have names as such. Each name exists in a namespace. In which namespace would you want your function to create that name? so I've got two classes a car class and a DMV class (w/ blank list to store cars as they are created). I have an add car function to add the car to the list but I would like to make a function to be called when the user wants to create a new car. It won't have to be a unique named instance? Not car1 or car13 or anything? No. Objects don't have to have names at all. Like the `1` in `x = [1 2 3]` doesn't have a name. Okay so if I made a create_car() function and the Car class has only (self plate) like ```pythondef create_car(): input('Enter plate#: ) plate = input``` then had it call my add_veh() function would that work? that snippet's a bit too heavy on the pseudocode side to be of much use tbh `'foobar'` is the value of the plate unless your class has a check that verifies that the plate is unique it wouldn't throw an error,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No there's no ++ operator by itself ves zappa since when did you realizew how big server you made is `++` used for something else in the language? bc if not they should add it imo could you explain further serdar? @Pea `+` can be used as a unary operator which means taht `++n` would be `+(+n)` There are a number of reasons for why you may want to avoid the complications and gotchas of post versus pre increment while desinging a language though @Fisher when you run something in a function it sometimes runs faster I think because it takes less time to look up names in the local space whereas if you run it in the body of the module it takes longer because it has to search the global namespace thanks you spent most of your time shitposting so it's hard to find out what you asked. ok sorry but answer its important @Fisher generally this only manifests when you're doing stuff in a tight loop but that's one of the common things I can think of that would cause such behavior.

Difference between a list and dictionary.> A list is an ordered sequence of objects whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. However the main difference is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position. ... The values of a dictionary can be any type of Python data. So dictionaries are unordered keyvaluepairs. Well @Armin Saiury Crocky are you trying to walk before you can run? i thought i can copy paste all the words there and then use python to search for individual ones? You can copy and paste into a .txt and search the file yes! but can i search for certain content inside of it? Yes you would store the file data in another variable string and then turn the string into a list and then do what we are telling you to do which is ```string in list: do something``` ```pywith open(""my_text_file.txt"") as f: for line in f.readlines(): if query in line: print(line)``` something like this basically. ^ see: docs on inbuilt types and functions.<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html><https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html> Hello well I will try my best!!

My question is would i be better off using pygame or tkinter to do this? you'd be better off making an image of it and modifying it via cmd line programmatically easier said than done though lot of steps between what I just said and how you get it I think its important to know what is the map like is it always the same size same format what is it guys how does this look for an astorid game astoroid game is good thnx I am making such a game myself and just downloaded some png's from google LUL for this specific map yea it will always be the same size and format. I havnt got to the point of using different maps i just want to make it for this map before thinking about any other maps and yea that looks good > I am making such a game myself and just downloaded some png's from google LUL@Vantablack yeah me too lol Did you get far with your code? @Ansh this far None I am about half way done could be useful for us to compare it when it's done no bad idea at least not mine i would probably make your worse Oh I have about 200 lines of code atm. It was really fun to make I think you will enjoy it I still gotta add a lot of stuff for now I have movements enemies spawning shooting and collision yea are you using pygame? yep you will see in pygame you gotta write all logic yourself watch some starting tutorials hello i am watching one currently where hes making a flappy bird to learn how to use the images in a program i ask I found some guy has a 2030 video series on pygame explains pretty much everything I used the sqlmap hello @Deleted User How python verison is used the sqlmap program? > I think its important to know what is the map like is it always the same size same format what is it@Vantablack i think it's possible to calculate max width and draw squares based on that None @endlesstempest I think you should not start by making it for this specific map you have atm. You should decide before writing will map always be the same or it can vary cause it will make the code and logic different it ths version the used the sqlmap? yup @Vantablack oh forgot you asked me that its 600 and 800 or make it so that you can calculate the image size and adjust the squares based on that it's a huge mistake to do it based on one image first thing I can suggest ark is to not hardcore screen size like that use variables you will reference screen size a lot and you can change it easily later second thing I can suggest is to not use pygame for this unless you're turning this into an actual game which I don't think you are for dnd I'd just squeeze out an image for printing out @Deleted User those are 2 different people @ ark and @ endlesstempest > use variables you will reference screen size a lot and you can change it easily later@Vantablack ok so x = 800 and y = 600 some thing like that right? I can't even tell lol @Ansh `screen_width = 800 screen_height=600` or something yea profile pictures look the same to me lol endless attempt is a bird and im a letter a dunno how you could get confused btw that `screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width screen_height))` shouldnt i input hieght before width or is just in javascript? well do you know how x,y axis work? yea all coordinates in pygame are (x y) x  hieghtand y is width right? topleft corner is 0 0 x is along y is up x is width or down here oh my bad lol always forget that sequence meth I suggest when you get further down with your code to also use classes ark for game objects i will I did the mistake of not using them and basically rewrote my code like 3 times it was a good learning experience sqlmap @DudeBro @Hadeez Hello everyone!

When should someone use Selenium over requests and vice versa Generally you should use Requests It communicates using standard HTTP Selenium emulates a browser such as Firefox or Chrome to work around sites with active content or other issues that preclude the use of direct HTTP requests I See. I've been using Selenium and its quite a interesting tool But I heard requests is faster Requests is much faster Since it's simply making a HTTP request vs manipulating a browser process to make one or more requests on your behalf So can requests find elements in way that Selenium can? Or is it a different process? Depends you probably will need to use Beautiful Soup for that Requests does basic parsing If you want an allinone package take a look at `requestshtml` https://github.com/psf/requestshtml It includes requests and beautiful soup parsing along with a few other things I guess my main question is if requests can interact with the page the same way Selenium interacts with a page via keys Because that is an essential part of my next project the first program i made is a guess the number game  lol anyone know how i upload it to google drive / sheets? No requests doesn't emulate keypresses like selenium does because it makes HTTP requests No Javascript is being executed @Magic gist.github.com I'm assuming you want the code shared somehow and a Gist is the best way to do that. You could upload a .py file to Google Drive and do a share using that but that requires a Google account and is fairly complicated. Then paste the code into a .py file upload it to drive and share it from drive. I don't know the specifics of google unfortunately but there's likely documentation on how to do so if needed.

Yes; dicts aren't a great data structure to change the order in cause the only thing in the dicts are key value pairs Dicts are for when you want to find things by keys; lists are for when you want to find things by their position @Xplode swap keys and values (if no duplicates) new_dict = dict([v: k for k v in old_dict.items()]) @Isaiah The Greatest I think you want `print(str(mail[0]) str(mail[1]))` @Xplode each element in a list can be anything.

So is `int`. So is `str` for strings. Classes are for anything that you want to have multiple independent variables of. Alternatively with just append```pyold_list = [1 2 3]new_list = []for item in old_list: new_list.append(item  2)``` Im not sure if Im thinking this right but are having 2 classes like have 2 different scripts? I usually have like one script for GUI and other for back end anyone wanna join me in #helpchocolate :S? Please don't advertise your help channel. If someone can help then they will. Just be patient. I am it's soon to expire sadly Is there a way that I can start a background task with asyncio in Python like threading? @Djdude02 The point of classes is to let you create multiple objects of a single type and have each of those objects hold it's own independent state. Classes also allow encapsulating that state to allow invariants to be enforced like that a particular attribute is always positive or something like that List is a class. Your program is able to create multiple lists. Those lists don't share data. The lists expose methods to manipulate their state by adding or removing elements or sorting the elements. Makes more sense Classes are just user defined types composed of state that is made up of existing Python types and exposing methods allowing users to read or change that state. That's it.

It is fairly easy pls show me how dm me You just need two inner loops because i have no idea No we don't help through DMs as other people here could learn from that oh Okay let's start from the beginning can you simply write two nested loops? i dont really know how None has to look like that it's part of a BMI calculator You write a loop and another loop inside can you give me an example ```pyfor i in range(40): for i in range(30): ... ``` These are two nested loops Instead of hard coding 40 and 30 we can use your matrix size Do you know the side of it? 9x5 9 columns 5 rows So let's change that ```pyfor i in range(9): for i in range(5): ... ``` 5 rows not 3 My bad saul good man What do you want to put inside your matrix as a default value? there is none wait 1 min btw this should be on help channels No help channels seems free at the moment ```mwp = int(input(""Enter minimum weight in pounds: )) mxwp = int(input(""Enter maximum weight in pounds: )) wsv = int(input(""Enter weight step in pounds: )) mhi = int(input(""Enter minimum height in inches: )) mxhi = int(input(""Enter maximum height in inches: )) hsv = int(input(""Enter height step in inches: )) ``` that's what i have Well let's continue from the two loops how would i take that input and convert it into a matrix ok could someone #helporange ? You want to create a new list at the beginning of the code and then add some lists inside of it at each iteration right ? yes Something like this but nested```pyl = []for i in range(10): l.append(42)``` Can you try to write that? want me to put it in the IDLE? want me to give you the pseudocode? You should try to refactor this to nest two of them You should just try to write the code refractor? Refactor i dont think i have learned that yet You see we have those two loops up here yea And we have this snippet here that uses a loop to create a list Now we need to put them together to create a list in the inner loop (the second one) and then add it to the matrix in the outer loop (the first one) Does that make sense to you? yes Firstly let's put our list creation inside the inner loop ```pyfor i in range(9): lst = []  for i in range(5): lst.append(None)``` the object is to take a minimum and maximum height and weight value with a step value (let's say four) from the 2 user inputted weight numbers print the list in between those numbers with the values within the last to increase by 4 each time until the max number is reached. Do the same thing with the height numbers and then make that into a matrix The rest should be pretty straightforward we simply need to append `lst` to the bigger list at each iteration This is way more complex than just creating a matrix The end result should look like this```pymatrix = [] for i in range(9): lst = []  for i in range(5): lst.append(None) matrix.append(lst)``` ok",,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Both are mutable so there shouldn't be a difference Python passes by object reference You're kinda using dictionaries wrong aren't you? @Etherlord either i don\'t understand sth and i messed sth up or there\'s really a difference. the example from stackoverlow shows that the outerscopelist is being modified while my code:```pythonfrom copy import copy deepcopyvars = { \'a\ \'b\ }def _prepare(vars): vars = copy(vars) vars.update({ \'c\ }) return varsprint(id(vars))print(vars)print()prepared_vars = _prepare(vars)print(id(prepared_vars))print(prepared_vars)print()print(id(vars))print(vars)print()```run on https://repl.it shows that the outerscopeset is not affected at all xD hello Dicts need key value pairs? is anyone available to help me When I finish my project can someone review my code (onetoone) and I will pay them? @Crimson When you pass `5` you can\'t modify it to `6` because in Python ```pya = 5a = 6``` doesn\'t mean ```reserve memory for a single integer then set that memory to binary representation of 5set the memory in this area to a binary representation of 6```. Instead it means ```create a name a create an integer object `5` assign that object to that namecreate object `6` assign that object to the name a""``` ```pyclass Cat(self name): def __init__: Meow meow I\'m a cat :) Please care for me!"" return My name is  + name def feed(self): return Meow yummy!"" def wash(self): return Splash splash meow!"" def meow(self): return name +  says meow!""``` Is there a problem with this code or is this 2.7 format? I really like the stickynote analogy for names in Python @Deleted User i'm pretty sure you can't return from `__init__` @Crimson So in both cases a dictionary and an integer the function you pass an object to doesn't modify the assignment to a name. It's just that if the object is mutable then the function can modify it in place. @PureFunctor Oh oops lmao and when you define `__init__` it takes self (`__init__(self)`) as the instance needs it as an argument to point to its self can somebody help me? i was following a yt tutorial and idk what i did wrong @PureFunctor @Etherlord ok i understand everything now!!!sorry for all the commotion. my problem was i explicitly copied `vars = copy(vars)` and then updated. if i hadn't copy anything the `outerscopeobject` would be changed:ashamed:?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ thank you very much guys !!!idk how did i miss that detail ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ you dont pass the parameters to the class definition so ```pyclass Cat(self name): def __init__:``` should be ```pyclass Cat: def __init__(self name):``` @Crimson Just to make it super clear notice how the behavior is exactly the same for `int` and `list`: ```pymy_int = 5my_lis = [5]def modify(an_int:int a_list: list): an_int = 10 a_list = [10]print(my_int my_lis)modify(my_int my_lis)print(my_int my_lis)``` exactly xDlocal symbols can be rebind to new values without any harm for the global symbols/objects.also:\\> when the passed object is mutable you can update its state.\\> when the passed object is NOT mutable you can only rebind the local symbol.

I think iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve seen stack overflows but not heap hm None As for the heap that is managed by a garbage collector. You can allocate lots of objects and eventually run out of heap space and Python will raise a MemoryError but it\'s going to take a fair amount of time. You actually did that with your \'stack overflow\ example in the question. You stored a reference to a string on the stack this string took up all the free memory available to the process. As a rule of thumb Python stores a reference to a heap structure on the stack for any value that it can\'t guarantee the size of.

What The script There no errors Ok but it can Still cause a crash @Hanz If you want to check the specific version of `pip` used in the virtual environment of some PyCharm project then the easiest way is probably by opening the internal terminal (should be a button for that near the bottom) which has the venv activated by default and typing `pip version`. @_||_|D|| can you post the code so we can take a look thanks anyone here have any experience using unet? ```python# Should move all zeroes (0) to the enddef move_zeros(array): list_of_zeroes = [] for idx,val in enumerate(array): if (0 == val) and (type(val) is int): list_of_zeroes.append(array.pop(idx)) array.extend(list_of_zeroes) return array``` ```pythonIn [21]: m1 = [""a"",0,0,""b"",None,""c"",0,1,False] In [22]: move_zeros(m1) Out[22]: [\'a\ 0 \'b\ None \'c\ 1 False 0 0]``` it doesn't move all the zeroes. Something wrong I am doing? yes you're popping from the list that you're looping over after the pop(index) list just does not settle itself? the easy fix is to loop backwards ```pythonIn [31]: m1 Out[31]: ['a 0 b None c 1 False 0 0]In [32]: m1.pop(1) Out[32]: 0In [33]: m1 Out[33]: ['a b None c 1 False 0 0]``` pop() seems to handle itself fine but I am sure I am missing something more fundamental or it is enumerate? any link for explanation? the problem is that your loop doesn't know that an element was removed from the list popping shifts elements to the left and the loop doesn't know about that.

But I need its functionality on browsers so no way around it. haha you could consider using something like brython https://brython.info/ Ah yeah I ran into that a while ago. Thought I could get into it but it's finicky. I'm not sure it would actually work but I could definitely try... I wonder if they wrap the BigInt js lib c: Avoid JS Don't forget about Dart Kotlin and Typescript They'll likely do everything you need without needing to touch that godawful language heh @Austin i believe brython is literally an entire python interpreter written in JS so most of what works natively in cpython could work in brython it's definitely worth a shot at least. Yeah my code uses gmpy2 which is a python wrapped C lib however it only uses it for large primality checks and a few other things I'd be astonished if brython supported exactly the same language as python3.7 e.g. I bet they're perpetually a couple years behind Oh yeah there's no `async` code in there but it definitely uses 3.5+ syntax What would brython do with the walrus operator i believe brython is up to 3.8 None I am astonished ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ haha it's certainly impressive. WOW and it does support async too by the looks of it. None i'm referring to this by the way: https://github.com/brythondev/brython/releases None haha maybe they do Patreon or similar i mean i've never used brython myself but if it lives up to its claims then it's definitely intriguing. There's also stuff like Pyodide: <https://github.com/iodideproject/pyodide> I have used it a couple years ago and played around with the DOM stuff... It was when I was really just trying to avoid learning javascript altogether Didn't keep up with them though And learned Vue.js instead lol I strongly suspect that if you're doing web you cannot avoid learning JS. Even if you use something that's layered on top of it. it's certainly good to know sure. there's something to that yes do you agree with that Humorous blanket statements are not generally an absolute truth but it seems fair to say that data scientists in general probably have (or at least try to have) those characteristics are there even statisticians any more who aren\'t data scientists? never met one HOt takes with inclement the ones that research into stats purely,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

C# Is mostly used for Unity C++ Mostly used for unreal engine or Godot Do you want to make your own engine or do you want to use yours? There are a lot of bots made in python as well @shira  in fact our @Python and our @Sir Lancebot are both in python and they are open sourced Reason why much of Bots is not written in Python is performance. JS performance is a bit better than Py's especially DB communication (based on my tests) I'd still recommend discord.py thanks to its command structure and python optimizes a lot of dev time as well I'm just new to programming I don't understand why theres alot of languages What is the command for bot dm message? As there are different tools for different jobs there are languages to help interact with those technologies `discord.Member` and `discord.User` are `discord.abc.Messageable` so they both have `.send()` method @Schwifty and you can use it to send messages in DM Do you know about Julia?

What should I do now what's next? I am really struggling to set a stable longterm goal. Perhaps try and make some big programs now @Pioyi If you don't know enough use the internet https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/512380396235653141 There are challenges you may wanna look into Oh thank you But how is a big python project like? When Pioyi said I have made a bunch of small programs I thought they were implying that they were sort of bored of doing that and they wanted something else to do @Pioyi It depends on the porject project Exactly If you want to make a python system like I am currently working on it can range from 1 line of code to maybe infinite because there are so many features you could implement Actually maybe not a 1 liner Actually maybe yes a 1 liner Lol. @Pioyi Pick something that you care about in the real world and build a project around it. Pondering the possibilities in my mind Is Github a great platform for publishing my work? Yes ```pyif (input(""Username:""),input(""Password:""))==(""The correct username"",""The correct password""): print(""Correct."")``` Or maybe ```pyif (input(""Username:""),input(""Password:""))==(""The correct username"",""The correct password""): print(""Correct."")else: print(""Incorrect"")``` To be slightly more userfriendly (I'm talking about short password systems) Lol. Does anyone know how to make that shorter? Apart from turning it into a module and just doing import (moduleName) instead lol If only correct then`if condition: print(""Correct"")` ```pyif condition: print(""Correct"")else: print(""Incorrect"")``` would work too iirc If we talk only about having least amount of lines Single line would be lambda prolly I'd gather your username and password first and then compare them one at a time because that way the logic is clearer @Infinimata The aim here is least amount of lines though When you go for code golf logic doesn't matter much @Infinimata You'd just try and see how long lamda you can build OK if this is golfing that's another story I came inlate :D `print((""Incorrect"",""Correct"")[(input(""Username:""),input(""Password:""))==(""The correct username"",""The correct password"")])` maybe ```py(lambda: print(""Correct"") if condition else print(""Not correct"")()``` perhaps `print((""Incorrect"",""Correct"")[condition])` is I think as short as an if expression gets (sometimes you need to switch it and do > 0 / < 0/not as not every condition returns a boolean I tried a + but it didn't work What's an API?",,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You're welcome > Cython does some neat optimizations that can make things just a tad bit fasterCythonizing something like this makes pretty minimal optimizations since it's still calling to the Python C API```pythondef py_loop(): x = 0 for i in range(50): x += i``` But then if you optimize it suddenly you're actually using a C loop```pythondef cy_loop(): cdef int x = 0 cdef int i for i in range(50): x += i``` For Game Jam are you allowed to use standard libraries? Or _only_ `arcade`? You are allowed to use all of the stdlib ok The main framework has to be `arcade` Reason I ask is because a lot of the packages I wrote for personal use would seem to work really nicely with this seems a bit unfair to use already written code I wouldn't be c/p it I'd be writing it from scratch. It would have to be anyway I guess what I should have said was the concepts I used make me feel better about what I might write for game jam. Or knowing the concepts I did.. or used,... or something idk well that's why everyone's been given some time to learn the arcade f/w I suspected that was the case. What I meant was I've worked with sprites in CSS before and other things like that. While I'm sure that is true of most participants I'm just saying I won't feel completely lost I just feel better. i'm not competing but there's _probably_ something in the framework for sprites anyway? Yeah I noticed that shortly after I was thinking about what I just mentioned. All I made was a spritesheet/stylesheet generator. Doesn't help me anyway but at least I have something to go on If it's your code you can use them it sounds like you should play around with the framework a bit whilst you have time I just signed up 5 minutes ago I'm actually reading the docs at the moment nice i hope you come up with something cool ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I have an interesting idea I think. I've been working on a gacha simulator kind of thing and I'm thinking of using a similar system so that repeated gameplay isn't the same ```pydef greeting (username=None): if username: print (f""Hello {username}"") else: print (f""Hello !"")greeting()``` @Hackysack don't get attached to any idea yet i'm pretty sure you're going to be given a task when it begins I know. Doesn't hurt to mull over a couple ideas though true I'd say I hope you come up with something cool as well but I don't know if you're participating or not. If you are I _know_ you'll do something interesting with a creative name such as yours. i'm not competing aw i have the time but i'm a slow laptop that hangs too much otherwise i'd give it a go maybe next time i can be the designated cheerleader or something Game development is like the one thing I'm not really interested in so a lot of the requirements for the performance details I don't quite understand yet. And I have an allinone PC with a _terrible_ GPU (or graphics card or magic images or interdimensional cable idfk) the guy that wrote the framework is hanging out in the game jam channel to help out you could ask them for pointers maybe Someone is getting assistance at the moment don't want to interrupt and start asking questions before I even research it Oh by the way anyone who remembers me talking about the sudoku solver I was writing... I'm up 20 or 30 puzzles in the solved category for this list of 291 rangingdifficulty puzzles. 214 solved now. I underestimated the range of the difficulties. Massively. Because I found a site with a `csv` file with a million sudoku puzzle strings and after several hours all but one had been solved. I'm thinking someone put together a fairly easy list and stuck one stupid hard one in there because none of my scripts solves it. Even the backtracker that ran for an hour or so. My solver is not advanced by any means. But it was still interesting how those events played out hmm. didnt mean for that to be so long If I could just generate my own puzzles of arbitrary difficulty I'd understand a bit better where I'm going wrong. Does it mean that python can't multithread <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock> Global Interpreter Lock. Keeps you bound to one process (I believe). But you can absolutely do that type of thing with `threading` `mulitprocessing` or `async` _the GIL is a good thing_ <https://realpython.com/pythongil/> this explains well No need to apologize. I still have trouble with them So python can do two different things at the same time > The GIL is a single lock on the interpreter itself which adds a rule that execution of any Python bytecode requires acquiring the interpreter lock. This prevents deadlocks (as there is only one lock) and doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t introduce much performance overhead. But it effectively makes any CPUbound Python program singlethreaded. I'd suggest reading those pages neon linked. They will explain it really well single threaded = no parallelism I tried implementing some sort of parallelism into my solver. Seems like it should be relatively easy seeing as I can multithread image downloads for 10x speed increase. But I have trouble with shared resources sounds like you can come back to concurrency at a later stage then I'm definitely not that knowledgeable.
