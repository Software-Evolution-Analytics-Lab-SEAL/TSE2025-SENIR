My name is Manuel I am new to Clojure (I'm still reading a book about it I haven't worked on a project before. I come from the world of Elixir) Right now I'm on a technologies choice process for a project that I'm going to start with a friend A project related to the area of Civil EngineeringThere will be a lot of formulas Maths Calculus limits derivatives logarithms etc.My friend is a Civil Engineer so he puts the formulas and I put the programming part Besides it will be necessary to visualize data in the form of 2D and 3D charts We want at first to develop a desktop applicationI think Python does an excellent job on that field so it's not discarded I know Python and it would be easier for me I also thought on doing it with Qt which is an excellent framework for desktop applications. Besides C++ is a mature technology and I know that any issue that I face during development will have been solved by anyone in the past The problem with C++ is that I'm not a big fan of OOP But I want to do it with Clojure I want to consider Clojure because I think that it would be the best way for me to learn the language well. It's just that the lack of knowledge I have about Clojure doesn't let me take a decision on using or if it will solve my problem I would like to ask please: 1. Which framework do you recommend to create the type of desktop application that I need? I've seen a lot of options but I don't know how to decide 2. Do you think Clojure have the right libraries for Data Visualization and for complex Math and Calculus topics like the ones I told you about? 3. Do those Data Visualization libraries if they exist can be used and integrated with the desktoporiented frameworks? Or it's just for web? 4. What should I do to export the final project to an installable executable .exe for Windows? Does that exist on Clojure? Can we do that? I use Linux but if the project goes well our clients would be using Windows mostly 5. Is there good documentation about these libraries in the case they exist? I'd aprecciate if you could comment me your experience. I think Clojure is very powerful but I want to take a good decision on which technology to choose because at the end I don't wanna have a technical debt Desktop applications aren't super common to be made in Clojure. You could use either electron with CLJS but that'd be a bit complicated. Halgari's fnfx is probably a good place to go if you want something really functional but also seesaw is quite good if you want something simple but closer to java's style. As for library support clojure has many libraries of its own yes but for nearly any topic that you can't find a good library for clojure you can find a decent library for java which you can use from clojure easily. As for making an installer java in general doesn't do that as their default manner of working with programs. Nearly any extractiontype installer will be decent for the resulting application however. > Desktop applications aren't super common to be made in Clojure.

Halgari's fnfx is probably a good place to go if you want something really functional but also seesaw is quite good if you want something simple but closer to java's style.@srasu FWIW I would probably look at `cljfx` rather than `fnfx` if you're looking to do a JavaFX desktop app in Clojure. It's more modern and uses more recent design approaches. fair enough (background: I was working on a desktop app a few years ago and as part of that did a bit of work on `fnfx` to update it but then the project kind of fell apart so I haven't revisited since then) If you have a decent editor it should Just WorkÇï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ otherwise figwheelmain has some instructions on how to switch repls right but you should be able to integrate the two by having the figwheel lein plugin injected by cider and starting the repl that way.,,,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How would you import a library like this https://github.com/lambdaisland/trikl using leiningen? It's made with deps.edn not on clojars...

For example suppose I am trying to proxy pass everything under `mysite.com/util/` to the running luminus web app. If luminus has no knowledge of the `/util/` prefix all absolute paths will improperly go to `mysite.com/`. I determined a workaround by just modifying the `<project>.layout/render` function that comes with the luminus template to the following:```=(defn render= renders the HTML template located relative to = resources/html""= [request template & [params]]= (contenttype= (ok= (parser/renderfile= template= (assoc params+ :pathprefix (or (env :pathprefix) )+ :selmer/context (or (env :pathprefix) )= :page template= :csrftoken antiforgerytoken)))= text/html; charset=utf8""))```Then all templates are able to generate links properly by just referencing the `pathprefix` and script/style Selmer tags continue to work as well.

I'm getting what I consider strange behavior where after calling shutdownagents my program still won't exit and seems to have nondaemon threads going on. It has a lot of core.async go blocks and agent usage but nothing too weird. @srasu I do not think that `shutdownagents` has any effect on threads/threadpools that are created from clojure.core.async (`thread`/`go`). I believe that it only interacts with the Agent subsystem of clojure.core (`agent` `send` and `sendoff`). Then I'm definitely curious because I've never had issues shutting down applications with live goloops before. Do you have any blocking/IO actions going on in your go processes? Just waiting on channels. so parking Try closing all of your channels instead. That will allow your go blocks to terminate That... would be a challenge. Might be possible but we'll see. Wait nevermind. That's weird. Actually it looks like I exit the go block. Yeah so in theory there's no go blocks running and no agents since I call shutdownagents. It's just weird.

I haven't really looked that deeply into it but I presume it's enough for smaller and personal use cases? I hear a good amount about Crux haven't used it myself though There is `alt` in core.async but is there something like `and` that reads input from channels in whatever order it comes in? For example I have channel one and two. I want to take something from both of them but I don't care whether one or two delivers first What do you mean? I don't understand your point Of course it's async We're talking about core.async after all Building the logic of `and` is possible with the existing macros/functions but I was wondering whether something like this already exists I actually wrote something that does that a few days ago cus I couldn't find a solution in core.async. But I might have missed something. What `or`? Do you mean `alts!`? Different semantics I wish there were a good parking and in core.async by default yeah. As it is the simplest way to do it is like so:```clojure(let [chans ...] (a/<! (a/thread (map a/<!! chans))))``` This spawns a new thread that blocks on taking off each channel and the return value of map is put onto a channel. That channel is parked on by the outer execution context. what if you're working in cljs Wrong channel I suppose good question. I'm not 100% sure. Short answer is you need some fairly arcane loop trickery. And `alts!` You loop on `alts!` each iteration removing the channel you just took from and passing the rest back in. Yeah I dislike that because it's complex and requires more thread overhead. However it doesn't require an additional thread so that can be a bonus. ```clj(defn asyncall [chans] (goloop [chanset (set chans) res {}] (if (seq chanset) (let [[val chan] (alts! chanset)] (recur (disj chanset chan) (assoc res chan val))) (into [] (map res chans)))```Or something like that.

There are a few things about yours that are a bit problematic for example it uses .indexOf and last on sequences all of which are O(n) ( @Kanishkkumar188nrt ) Yes pleaze Please show your implementation ```clj(defn sieve [[& [nextprime :as remaining]]] (remove #(zero? (rem % nextprime)) remaining))(defn primes [to] (>> (range 2 to) (iterate sieve) (takewhile seq) (map first)))``` `sieve` is a helper function that takes a sequence of numbers ignores the first element treats the second element as the next prime and the rest as the remaining numbers. It then uses `rem` (remainder) to remove all multiples of the next prime from the remaining This is nice for `iterate`. `iterate` takes the initial numbers and produces a sequence of `numbers` `(sieve numbers)` `(sieve (sieve numbers))` and so on This results in a sequence consisting of sequences that each represent one step in the algorithm The end is reached when this produces an empty sequence hence why `(takewhile seq)` The first element of each sequence is a prime. This is reasonably more efficient too. Your initial solution took 292 ms for 9927 mine took 0.02 ms If you have trouble understanding anything feel free to ask Well that is something that comes with enough practice. Don't worry if you think you wouldn't have figured this out yourself  I know that feeling. Coding in an imperative language is somewhat of an advantage in this regard because most popular algorithms are often defined or explained imperatively. The sieve of Eratosthenes is a good example for this because it is an inherently imperative algorithm (a set of instructions that you can repeat by hand). And I mean it took me about half an hour to come up with this. What I did is the following: I went to wikipedia and looked at the definition of the algorithm there which is tagging indices in a boolean array essentially. I realised that this can also be described as a series of states. In the beginning all numbers are untagged. After the next step all multiples of 2 are tagged. After the next step all multiples of 3 are tagged... and so on and so forth. This is already a functional description. Now the remaining questions are: what does the \'step\ function look like that marks the next multiples? and how do I get the relevant prime in each state (2 in the first 3 in the second 5 in the third etc.)? Now the knowledge about `iterate` comes in handy because it gives me a sequence of all states when repeatedly applying a step function. So what I did was I wrote the step function (`sieve`) in a way that does not care about what was relevant in the previous step by skipping the first element in the sequence. That way the first element in each state is the number I care about. And I think the rest of the implementation of `sieve` is pretty clear. Yes it is The code is so clear in itself that i doesnt need any explanation the explanation to write such code was needed I am reading your explanation again n again to understand better. Thanks @Johnny and Clojurians As helping community only enables the propagation of knowledge. You're welcome. Thanks for bringing it up here it's an interesting thing to think about and I really like the result here I have worked with multiple languages and never ever found anyone as welcoming and helping community as Clojure's Same here haha Clojure's community is so helping and uplifting and through out all the mediums be it reddit discord slack or stack overflow When i printed next prime and remaining i got this > remainaing (19 23 29 31 37)>nextprime 23 I understood this but how could you do this is there any documentation for it Youre doing some very WHAAAAT the hell kinda things This is called destructuring. It's very powerful. This would be the equivalent without it:```clj(defn sieve [input] (let [remaining (rest input) nextprime (first remaining)] (remove #(zero? (rem % nextprime)) remaining)))``` https://clojure.org/guides/destructuring M blown away For a long time I didn't know it existed. Now I find myself using it at every corner I understand destrcuture as i used in javascript but you did something really clever here by using & you made it for consuming multiple arguments and with using :as you selected the first item from that multiple aruments Correct? It's all described thoroughly in the guide I just linked and I recommend reading it but the gist of it: `[& foo]` means that `foo` will be the `rest` of the input  `[foo]` means that `foo` will be the `first` of the input  and `[foo :as bar]` means that `foo` will be the `first` of the input and `bar` will be the original input And this can all be nested as I did here Sure thanks I will go through it,,,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am new to the clojure code. Do you have a collection of all agents? Yes @isenjov I have collection of agents.I am just modifying Rich Hickey's ant colony simulation. @gibb I do have a sequence of agents.I want to somehow update a count variable which would be shared by all the agents to update it. when all the agents update the variable i ll print the count. @gibb @lsenjov,,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't believe so That is really tragic It should really be a thing considering that many frameworks and libraries require you to use specific threads or thread pools Yeah I don't mean globally I specifically want to look into raw TCP not websockets or anything else on top,,,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Would like to learn from it about how they use it. Particularly on how far they integrate with normal clojure code. i'm doing a small hackernewsish thing to better learn clojure. is making a protocol for query insertion and specs and records for posts/users and stuffs good model. Also when to use maps vs records? And though it doesn't matter for a small project do they have significant performance differences? performancewise records create fields for their explicit keys so you're likely to get better read performance than retrieving a value from a map as far as the protocols go it sounds like the things you're talking about using protocols for aren't all that different from core functions like filter and conj so I'm not sure if they'd be warranted  it seems like query and insertion would be on collections of things rather than the things themselves @feroxide you probably don't need records. stick with maps until you're sure you need otherwise,,,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oh huh it's implemented using reduce. Fancy that. in the case of `+` as a variadic function the difference is probably negligible but with a function like `str` the variadic form uses a StringBuilder to build up the string and then finally create one String whereas reduce would keep creating new StringBuilders and Strings for each reduction Oh yea you'd almost certainly want to apply str. My concern was more born out of variadic `+` causing a stack overflow. Any time I see stuff using apply on large collections on the jvm I get a little nervous tbh. Easy for a slightly naive implementation to blow up. Looks like the variadic str actually uses an inline `recur`sive anonymous function and a string builder. yeah  I imagine that's why the author avoided implementing it in terms of reduce I have a lot of faith in Rich having thought of that Sure I'd imagine just about anything in clojure's stdlib is fair game. one aspect of `reduce`'s usage is generalise this binary function to any number of arguments so in cases where the function can already take any number of arguments `apply` more precisely matches the intent i think. also of course it means you get to use the function author's intended semantics for that case as with `str`,,,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes you can As long as they're all in tail position I.e. the last statement in the recur scope thank you! Yeah as long as nothing uses the return value of recur in the scope of the loop or recursive function you're good. As a general rule anyway Johnny was more precise for sure. okie got it Thank you! Can I wrap a recur with a let? I have something that I need to use twice inside my recur But I don't want to compute it twice Yup as long as the let is in the tail position and the recur is in the tail of the let. thank you!,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Like pause half way through? And open up a repl? i have a function that adds timestamps to a map and want to test that it adds the correct time in ruby i would do smth like ```rubyTimecop.freeze(Time.now) do # do my tests here  # time will be frozenend``` Ohhh you're wanting to mock getting time? exactly; found an article about it that suggest in can be done but it's from 2012 :/ It's probably still fine. Clojure libraries don't change much Send link http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/11/clojurefreezingtimeaddedto.html also i have no idea which time library to use it's pretty confusing for a beginner Joda time will do you fine it's a wellused library Otherwise... pick one and play with it and see if you like it? Huh... actually maybe not joda time apparently it's fallen out just checked it and it provides a mock clock Aye just looking at```The Joda Time website says: Note that from Java SE 8 onwards users are asked to migrate to java.time (JSR310)  a core part of the JDK which replaces this project.``` But it should still do you decently yup that's what i'm using atm wrapping my test in with `(withclock (mockclock 0) ... ` lock time to `19700101` ?ï¿½È thanks for the help! next time I'll read the readme carefully ?ï¿½Ú,,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
