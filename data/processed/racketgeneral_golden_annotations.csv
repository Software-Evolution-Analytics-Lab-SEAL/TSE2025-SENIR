I'm thinking about the feasibility of implementing a Datomicesque toy DB in Racket. I think to make it work with a different kind of storage the existing runtime would need to be factored into a `theory` interface and then put together implementations for `hash` and persistent storage backends. Classic refactoring stuff. The language side will probably need to be extended in some way to handle whatever additional configuration needed to use a different storage. Oh! You could do a trick with external queries it looks like. That would be easier probably. External queries are probably not the right way. It would probably be a huge hack.

Typed Racket would not be able to infer the correct types for the functions introduced in the 3rd and 4th strategies without annotations. And I don't know whether Typed Racket's occurrence typing would play well with the 5th strategy... occurrence typing and mutation don't mix very well. I'd just nest two `cond` expressions I do think this is something that needs a better solution but that's the best I think can be done without building new features into internal definition contexts The first 2 have the problems associated with duplicating code. The next 3 have problems with Typed Racket. That leaves the 6th and last one which I suppose I should elaborate on:```(lambda (a) (let ([c? (and <condition b using a> (define c <computation c using a relying on b being true>) <condition d using a and c relying on b being true> (list c))]) (if c? (let ([c (car c?)]) <computation e using a and c relying on b and d being true>) <computation f using a relying on b or d being false>)))``` I\'m not sure what you mean by nest two `cond` expressions"". I have 2 conditionals an `and` and an `if`. In the initial example the `and` is nested in the conditionposition of the outer `if`.In the 2nd and 4th strategies the `and` is split to make a 2nd `if` in the thenposition of the outer `if`. Is that what you meant? I suppose another way to do this would involve continuations but adding `let/cc` or `let/ec` anywhere would trigger the same typeinference problems as the 3rd and 4th strategies The 5th strategy would be the most natural in an imperative language something like```(lambda (a) (declareuninitialized c) (if (and <condition b using a> (initialize! c <computation c using a relying on b being true>) <condition d using a and c relying on b being true>) <computation e using a and c relying on b and d being true> <computation f using a relying on b or d being false>))``` Although for occurrencetyping purposes I would want `c` to be immutable after it's been initialized like a blank `final` in Java This is a pretty vexing situation. I usually go with strategy 4 but it always feels like it should be possible without contorting the code so much.",,,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Yeah I basically wanna be able to raco pkg install from a local directory and be able to pre download a package so I have it in a local directory to be able to raco pkg install from @Majestyxrd that works for one package but doing that for the whole catalog one package at a time would probably suck I think there's a way to do it by stringing together some of the catalogrelated commands like `raco pkg catalogcopy` or something @thornAvery yes provided you pass the `X` identifier to the macro as an an argument (also in regards to your question about the local package stuff `raco pkg catalogarchive` does what you want) @Majestyxrd im using arch and racket yes. i dont think they know about racket cs yet lol going to have to wait until it gets fully integrated into racket or install racket cs on your own yeah there's no cs package in the main repos nor in aur so I thought I'd roll my own package but I don't know how just yet Building Racket from source is not too bad.

How do I distinguish those though?I tried to take inspiration from Carl Eastlund\'s `dict/c` implemented in `mischief/contract` but it doesn\'t use chaperones so it is free to both add an escape continuation and change the `failureresult` input to always be a new synthesized procedure. That way the new synthesized failureresult procedure can call the escape continuation. If I\'m constrained to chaperones I don\'t know how to do either of those things.How can I detect whether the `failureresult` is usedornot by the dict\'s implementation of `dictref` while keeping the `failureresult` a chaperone of the original failureresult?I have also asked on the Racket Users list: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racketusers/kHQmJh63mU/8SXYlmZzAAAJ @rocketnia I'm not bothered by _all_ quasiquotation in that file. Just stuff like this:````(,@xs @ys @zs)```That's just `(append xs ys zs)` with extra steps. I've even found a few cases of this:````(,x)```...because apparently `(list x)` wasn't arcane enough. I can see the usefulness of stuff like````(script ([type text/javascript""] [src scriptsrc]))```` ``,x` Some of those I only expect to see in test suites for quasiquotation The only time I heavily have used quasiquote is in implementing macros in pretty barebones scheme systems. I\'d mind it less if the template variables were always just variables not nested expressions. I\'d much rather read this:```scheme(define scriptsrc (... some complex expression ...))`(script ([type text/javascript""] [src scriptsrc]))` ```Than this:```scheme`(script ([type text/javascript""] [src (... some complex expression ...)]))```` I have a similar problem with large nested expressions That file also contained instances of this:```scheme(cond [(let ([x ...]) (and something? x)) => (lambda (x) body ...)])```which should just be:```scheme(define x ...)(cond [something? body ...])``` !! I don't think the `=>` form of `cond` clauses is a good idea @rocketnia I think my hangup here is that I don't want to use quasiquotation _or_ list manipulation functions. I want actual data structures. If I make a typo I want to find out fast.

(callwithfoo foo (lambda () body ...)))```I'd rather see a shorthand like `{body ...}` that gets turned into `(lambda () body ...)` @Markus R5RS is a specification. It's a document that describes a bunch of rules for how scheme code is supposed to work. Chez scheme is an implementation: it's an actual program that takes scheme code and runs it. Thank you chez scheme does not follow the rules of the R5RS specification. It does however follow the rules of the R6RS spec. Is there a module for it for Dr Racket? I know Racket is being built on top of it like something you can import in your code with `(require chezscheme)` and use somehow? or like #lang chez Not really. Chez is being used to _implement_ racket so you don't write chez code  the Racket implementation turns your racket code into chez scheme code and then hands it off to chez scheme to compile and run. There is a `#lang r5rs` (and I think `#lang r6rs` too) though. That lets you write R5RS scheme code and it will run as that spec says it should. okay thank you I usually try to write code that runs on Racket Chez and Guile with minimal changes.,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah I'm using it on Termux None (Set alias for racket ... It is a little more comfortable to run using `rkt` instead of `racket`) It works very well racket gui expects gnome I think to run gui apps And since Termux has x11 support I got to experimenting a bit with GUI lol Rlly? It works with Xfce4 on mobile ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ will racket run with just x111? gracket that is wow Gimme a moment I'll show it to you (If you screenshare from your phone to discord my head will explode) Hahaha I think that is not possible at the moment I was just lookign at the termux website None that is really cool. do you have a hdmi adaptor and a keyborad Yes this opens up a lot of possibilities No the x11 system runs directly inside the mobile and I connect to VNC. And yeah I have a external keyboard that looks like its bigger than a phone screen so drracket? or is that pushing things too far? It is a little more comfortable than the Android keyboard ... Sometimes I have very long codes and with the mobile keyboard it is a bit uncomfortable haha Ahh yes the x11 screen size can be configured I notice you are on 7.4? I'm guessing that is because 7.6 is too big? I think DrRacket isn't available for Termux at the moment... So I'm using Vim with some plugins i'm amazed. Is there a newer version? NiceI may have to wait for the Termux team to compile it for Android and my architecture to update have you tried `raco distribute` No I know very little about Racket yet I'm learning ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Anyway what it does? 7.7 due to be released soon. probably early may. raco distribute produces standalone executables > 7.7 due to be released soon. probably early may.Wow and what's new? > raco distribute produces standalone executablesOh I'll see it thanks! I've not been following the release testing. I expect racket(cs) will just keep getting better (faster). That's nice :o > I want to know if it is possible to make a deb package with Racket At first with Racket I was a bit confused by the syntax (I come from other languages \u200b\u200blike Ruby and JavaScript) however I adapted quickly and am comfortable using the parentheses ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is `raco distribute` and `raco exe` what you were lookign for? I know it doesn't answer the deb package but maybe a start? ```Unrecognized command: distribute```I got that maybe I need to execute `raco setup` first? wow! you have the three big syntax traditons!smalltalk>rubyc>javascriptlisp>racket > The raco distribute command combines a standalone executable created by raco exe with all of the shared libraries that are needed to run it along with any runtime files declared via defineruntimepath. The resulting package can be moved to other machines that run the same operating system. Wow I had not noticed that until now ```% raco distributeraco distribute: expects <destdir> [<executable>] ... on the command line given 0 arguments% raco hUsage: raco <command> <option> ... <arg> ...``` Ruby's syntax seemed very nice ... However the racket syntax does not stay behind. Despite not being what I'm used to it's very interesting Hmmm there are bad news for me... I can't use `distribute` or `exe` I got `Unrecognized command`... So I think I'll create executables by myself Have you tried using raco setup first? I've still not learnt ruby  I'm learning a little smalltalk because I'm thinking about making a small smalltalk `#lang` based on self Ruby is pretty dope imo > Have you tried using raco setup first?I'm doing it rn thx > I've still not learnt ruby  I'm learning a little smalltalk because I'm thinking about making a small smalltalk `#lang` based on selfOh it's a good idea!Ruby is very easy to learn... It's like python syntax lol Hmm I don't know much about that I think scribblelib is missing idk lolI'll install it manually and after run `raco setup` again I ran again and there are no more errors :GWomoGabSmile: @StephenD I'm putting together a simplistic lexer and parser for building Smalltalk langs I want to see if it could be a wrapper around `racket/class` but there needs to be some shims for keyword messages.

One that comes to mind is the Self programming language was implemented with a classless object system (like js) and the implementors proceeded to implement smalltalks class system in self.You may also like the racketcon talk Like a blind squirrel in a ferrari a few years ago or the Why Racket addendum in Beautiful Racket (by Matthew Butterick.) As a human using a language I think aspects to be considered are: Will learning this help me get a job? What is the documentation like? What are the learning resources like?  What is the community like?: Will I be welcomed? is it OK to ask questions? (even ones that I'm afraid might make me feel dumb uneducated or in some way less of a person) Can I learn(develop with it) on the computers I have available? school/college/university/work computer? chromebook? android phone or tablet? Window10 for ARM? Can I write programs on it that will work in the places I need them to? (server side web applications; Client side web applications; Windows Linux Mac gui apps; command line apps; terminal apps; iphone or android apps) I think the racket faq needs a couple more questions; Is Racket better than x?(for you)'I also want to add  Is Racket the same as scheme?  and point back to the reasons for the name change from PLTScheme to Racket. for me what is possible with this language? is a very important question and it\'s a big part of why I like racket Agreed  a big part of programming is making. So there is always an audience you are making for though sometimes that audience is me  and thats ok too.

Welcome (: How many programming languages would you consider yourselves fluent/proficient in? a dozen or two maybe? hard to say jeez I'm trying to settle on 3  5 and I can't decide. But I do know that less would be better. I'll be trying to evaluate Racket under that pretense. I think after you learn a few it becomes much easier to learn new ones they have a lot of overlap True they do. I'm really looking for a language to handle my text processing and/or rapid prototyping that can scale up I already know JavaScript and Rust might be the next thing I have to learn because people stan it super hard rust is pretty great That's what I hear But the syntax makes me sad The examples always make sense but the more complex you get the more my brain refuses to read it I love the Kisaragi Gentarou avatar. Oh my gosh it animates too. XD :tksSell: hmm I wonder if there's a good stepping stone on the way to Rust I would think Rust would be one of the best to learn these days in terms of community and being pretty cuttingedge rust has a lovely community So Racket. What do y'all use it for? since for work I write java I used it for some neat AI stuff earlier this year http://docs.racketlang.org/planning Oh neat. See this is the weird part about Lisps and Scheme. Everyone has these crazy cool projects and applications implemented in their flavor of choice but I can't seem to find a definitive example of a throwaway script or something that parses a CSV to make a report. ah yes the Lisp Curse I use it for that boring stuff. Like process a bunch of data over some HTTP API. SSH to a bunch of hosts and do a thing. Oh cool. Any nuances or caveats? Why Racket over X? (and as a result @oaktownsam has been an excellent use case tester for me ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) Lately I've chosen Racket over Python because the thread and event abstraction is much better. Nice.

I'm thinking of trying racket are there any fun projects you'd recommend to get familiar with racket? Messing around with `pict` `pict3d` and animations can be really fun There's something visceral about building graphical stuff in a REPL What are contracts in racket? They're like types but checked at runtime and they can do more than types usually do. Are they like enums in ocaml/c? No. They\'re more like checks in your code like this:```javavoid deleteIndex(List list int index) { if (index < 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(""index cannot be negative""); } if (index >= list.size()) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(""index must be smaller than the list size""); } ...}``` Racket contacts are an alternative to those sorts of explicit checks:```scheme(define/contract (deleteindex list index) (>i ([list list?] [index (list) (integerin 0 ( (listsize list) 1))]) [_ void?]) ...)``` That made sense thanks!

Yeah there are colour scheme options in settings. You can make your own colour scheme as well. it also goes off the OS if you set your OS to dark mode drracket will pick that up and change accordingly Let's say I have a set of facts in Prolog pertaining to students and teaches for courses. In the repl for Prolog I can do something like ```prologteaches(professor Course) studies(Student Course).```And it'll return every student being taught by `professor` in all their courses. I'm playing around with Datalog in Racket and I can't seem to be able to do this at the repl. I can define a rules```prologteaches_student(A B) : teaches(A Course) studies(B Course).```And then call that rule but I can't just run a query that has multiple terms to it. Does anyone know how I can do this in Racket's datalog? Currently I get this: Also to specify and OR in Datalog do I need to create a seperate rule for it since there's no equivalent to `;` in Prolog? Looking at the syntax for Datalog there are the following rules: ```ï¿½ï¿½?queryï¿½ï¿½? ::= ï¿½ï¿½?literalï¿½ï¿½? ?""ï¿½ï¿½?literalï¿½ï¿½? ::= ï¿½ï¿½?predicatesymï¿½ï¿½? ( )"" | ï¿½ï¿½?predicatesymï¿½ï¿½?

It's supposed to be a simple enum macro but it's giving me trouble. ```Scheme(defineenum a b c)```should expand to```Scheme(begin (define a 0) (define b 1) (define c 2))``` I suppose I can keep a variable outside `syntaxcase` within the lambda and mutate it with each iteration? I can do it if I pass an initial `0` value and iterate through that. Maybe I'll do exactly that and make it into an aux macro. ```Scheme(definesyntax defineenumaux (lambda (stx) (define (incrementsyntax stxn) (datum>syntax stxn (add1 (syntax>datum stxn)))) (syntaxcase stx () ((_ val) #'(values)) ((_ val (id newval) rest ...) #'(defineenumaux newval id rest ...)) ((_ val id rest ...) (withsyntax ((inc (incrementsyntax #'val))) #'(begin (define id val) (defineenumaux inc rest ...)))))))(definesyntaxrule (defineenum vals ...) (defineenumaux 0 vals ...))```Ehh this works I guess. Oh my god I wish R6RS had Racket's convenience procedures like `syntaxe` and `formatid`. ```Scheme(definesyntax definecenumaux (lambda (stx) (syntaxcase stx () ((_ enum val) #\'(values)) ((_ enum val (id newval) rest ...) #\'(definecenumaux enum newval id rest ...))

(definecenumaux enum 0 vals ...))``` That `withsyntax` is ugly as hell. Ah it's a bad idea to preemptively evaluate the enum value (`inc` here). There's always a chance that the given value isn't actually `number?`. That's too bad `syntaxe` is a primitive in `syntaxcase` iirc In theory yes. But it's not easy.

(see: https://download.racketlang.org/license.html) there is a #voice channel `racket` specifically `bin/racket` or `gracket` if you need gui stuff ok but regarding this sentence: Any program written in Racket that does not distribute the Regular variant racket binary itself is not affected by the license of that binary. If I build an application and bundle the runtime with raco exe ... is that the binary itself ? is my code then lgpl licensed ? this is really confusing sorry no racket moved to mit/apache and it confuses everyone yea but this clause made me insecure here but the thing to remember is your code is your code Where is that sentence? I'll see if it can be removed https://download.racketlang.org/license.html the sentence is: Any program written in Racket that does not distribute the Regular variant racket binary itself is not affected by the license of that binary. in conjunction with regular version of racket. my guess is this is needed but i did not understand it really Hey @StephenD ! Sorry about the house noise what noise? I muted but I'm hosting a small group at my house What are you working on? can you see my screen? Nope I was wonderign if that was working I just see two streams of your face rofl! Try showing your entire screen and not just one app :) sorry about that  my face once is enough. Twice is too much Hehe no worries I'll check out what's going on elsewhere @NeroLXIV https://docs.racketlang.org/license/index.html @NeroLXIV use CS variant if you are uncomfortable with LGPL None racket has two variants The traditional Racket runtime system includes code distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.The Racket on Chez Scheme runtime system embeds Chez Scheme which is distributed under the Apache version 2.0 license. the Chez Scheme (CS) variant is newer and faster and has has a cool nanopass compiler > Hm does this new runtime (with chez) have problems with racket gui? Seems like every racket program with gui spams errors to my terminal but does not start (e.g. drracket or a simple gui example i wrote). See: https://pastebin.com/N57znEYc etc... it never stops.@NeroLXIV that does not look good What version Racket ?What OS? Architecture? 7.7 ubuntu 20.04 64bit Do you have a sample program that triggers those errors ? just starting drracket triggers it. i also have a small program but i am currently on another machine Ok can you log those details on https://github.com/racket/drracket/issues/new and @StephenD so I get a notification: Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m on MacOS but Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll try DrRacket from the command line to see if I can reproduce the issue Ok I will create an issue then probably tomorrow. I just tried this on a ubuntu 18.04 vm at work and the same result. this is btw not a drracket issue but a gracket one. every start of gracket ends up like this Thanks that helps narrow things a little. Can I just check you are using 7.7 CS variant from https://download.racketlang.org ? If you have time can you check using a nightly snapshot? https://snapshot.racketlang.org https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/installers/racket7.7.0.6x86_64linuxcsxenial.sh https://docs.racketlang.org/raco/exe.html I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t use raco exe so I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know. It would be good to work out what is causing the errors for newer versions of Ubuntu If I can help with something feel free to ask The racket slack is much larger  someone there might know.

I found it more annoying than helpful. But that's generally how I feel about type systems anyways lol. Except Rust for some reason Rust feels much nicer to use than most other statically typed langs. God koyo has so much setup to do... You need to have multiple Postgres databases running need to have it running behind an nginx server even for local development need to have node and nvm way more than most web frameworks require for setting a basic application... Definitely not a best practices thing my background is in full stack web development and I\'ve never seen a framework that requires that much setup for its basic pregenerated application. Not even .NET does that and it\'s got the biggest pregenerated app I\'ve ever seen. Closest is maybe Laravel. For sure dockerizing it would make it much nicer maybe I\'ll set that up.

E.g. I would like a test that shows that (min 5) does not typecheck but (min 5 7) does. I did see that turnstile has this capability. I also see there is an asserttypecheckfail which is basically what I wanted so maybe that's a reasonable way to do it... makes me nervous to touch a big codebase without knowing how to write decent checks. That may be a good Slack/mail list/irc question. I thought SamTH was here but maybe that was short lived. He's the primary dev of TR and I know he is in those places. A difficulty I see is that those checks would probably have to run in some sort of metatype checking phase. Or rather they would need to be interleaved at type checking. A trick that could be done is providing the function under test and require it in an untyped module and then at runtime the contract system would throw an exception. Not sure 100% sure why you want to test this. If a typecheck fails the module will fail to compile. Thanks will try there. Want to check on the principle that you shouldn't change stuff without a test. (The item that needs testing is a change in the TR baseenv. Small but being careless isn't a good way to start.) Ohhhhh I thought you were testing user level types not base types. Yeah ask SamTH he will know.,,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Does anyone know of a Racket library/language that I can use for building FSMs like in graphviz that would work with Pollen? As soon as I finished typing that I realized I should really just search the page for `graphviz` and found this: https://docs.racketlang.org/graphviz/index.html So I'm gonna try that out and see if it works how I want Hmm doesn't look like there would be an easy way to do that all in one file the image would need to be included in the Pollen page as an external asset. Was hoping I could just do something like ```scheme#lang pollenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(require graphviz)this is some text ; Or something like this I guessï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(img>svg (makediagraph `(some code for the graphviz library)))some more text after a picture of my FSM``` It would be a dream though to be able to embed a graphviz diagram right inside markdown like this so easily... Of course you can do stuff like this in latex but latex is way more complicated than anything I need for 99% of use cases. Maybe after classes are done I'll try making something like it... Just joined Discord and saw this very useful to me as I was just using graphviz & tikz two days ago will be doing more. Ohh excellent thank you @StephenD! I'll post my question there then Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve only done a little pollen so Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m out of my depth ?ï¿½ï¿½ I've not done any!

I remember the problem being that i always felt like i had to define a new function brute force in order to handle new concepts. for example appending one chunk to another was easy but what if i wanted to stretch times exponentially or something Make your life easier and just start off with the GitHub desktop software and github  at least you wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t lose your work yes i learned my mistake haha can i get normal programming amidst the music notation ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ There are some music packages https://pkgd.racketlang.org/pkgn/search?q=Music unlikely they will help unless by some chance someone else is as esoteric as me but i will check it out Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been playing a little with puredata i used puredata for a long time save yourself the pain buy Max it's just 10$ a month you can subscribe and unscubsribe at will I have an Organelle M what's that now? damn come to think about it what i had in the past was essentially complete nowadays i'd remake in racket and have the parsing more integrated am i wrong to think that? being able to delineate the music parsing at any given point in the code and have it work would be ideal hmm but also ways of deconstructing those musical objects ?ï¿½ï¿½ this is going to be a lot of work ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ idk if it's worth it maybe i'm making it out to be more work than it really is i think i'm gonna go for it so i guess my real first question though google probably will suffice: where do i turn for Racket parsing? aha before i go any further to what extent can i have analysis built in? it would be awesome if while i'm coding i can check the values of certain things or listen to musical chunk is that an impossibility? There is the REPL that works. is that my only option? https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki/CreatingLanguages thanks many times i can't tell if it's my own stupidity or if the tools just don't work with me,in the past i found myself getting lost in the REPL all the time. it always felt disorganized. but i'm sure i only felt that way becuase i never learned REPL functions/commands for figuring out what variables you have stored or whatever other functions that helps you stay grounded and organized or is it that i should get better at quickly integrated text and REPL? tbh one text file and one REPL with the file opened would probably suffice for a single musical work or experiment i'm so dumb in the past i caused my own pain i'm done with that now this should be easy I jsut need to parse something like [ [ a a ] a a ] as a tree with \'a\ just as a placeholder symbol but there are also questions of efficiency.So the tree ultimately represents divisions of rhythm but in the past I would parse the entire tree then run a function that traverses the tree and essentially counts the branches and applies rhythmic values to the symbols within the tree.but i\'m thinking it would be more efficient that as it parses out the tree itself it keeps track of the numbers and applies them correctly o wait that can't work anyway let me not spam in here > I jsut need to parse something like [ [ a a ] a a ] as a tree,Using racket lists will do that No need for a parser just plain racket I think the pattern matching functionality will do what you need : https://docs.racketlang.org/reference/match.html This is just plain racket  no need for a parser  it is part of rackets own parser hmmm not sure how to accomplish what i want Start simple can i count the number of open parenthesis and count the number of symbols within a parenthesized group? Building blocks first The data structure is called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½listï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but it is a poor name because it is a syntax for building trees so i just run recursive length functions kek this will be easy can i have my symbols unquoted inside? agh what does quote mean again quote is the symbol itself not quoted is it evaluated ? > can i have my symbols unquoted inside?@giftfromgod yes itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s called quasiquote`\\` quasiquote o yes i remember reading but didnt get the usage so it didnt stick now i understand Backtick is the shorthand bruh Then commas to unquote racket is awesome or lisp or whatever whoever thought of that theyre a genius Lisp can do that too as can Scheme I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know who invented quasiquote Sounds like you have a good understanding of what you want to achieve and Racket has some helpful features. Do you have a plan? i think so. not the details just yet like when i get what i want out of the list it should be remembered Maybe start with some small things and build up? yes What are the first three things you want to do? but iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m thinking about when all is said and done the rhythm and notes are decoded from the list representation do i make a datatype to store them i like to see big picture before i start that way i realize stupid things earlier on so i dont waste time How will you specify rhythm ? the tree the tree is the rhythm lol `(1/4 1/4 1/2)`? what is that so for like (a a)each a is 1/2 (a a a) each one is 1/3 ((a a) a a)the first two are each halves of a third or in other words 1/6th each,then the two remaining aï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s are 1/3 and so on and so forth I see yup there are arbitrary choices involved im pretty aware of them like i can store them as consecutive intervals or i can store them as relative to the first element of the chunk,that choice determines how other functions work to concatenate and whatnot im worried ( 2 (c b a))(((a a a)(b b b)(c c c))) im worried this isnt good enough. something about the rigidity of the divisions rubs me the wrong way,even if i have functions to loosen it up (a function to introduce random deviations for example) @StephenD whats that? Repeat ( c b a ) twice Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not a musician but your description is hood Good its good but like i also worry about parameters at somepoint you just want knobs and sliders or other means of gui control but i dont want to overwhelm myself but idk what if theres a smarter way of accomplishing what i want to accomplish There is a gui toolkit yes i got fairly good at it already ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ its pretty awesome and straightforward the docs are fantastic with how they show you the layout of the idk what word to use How do you generate the sound?

I started working on an RFC for stream pipelines powered by transducers and reducers: https://github.com/jackfirth/rhombusbrainstorming/blob/streampipeline/stream_pipelines.md They're similar.

So you can do stuff like sorting and filtering but you can\'t make a transducer that does something like add a onesecond delay between each element If you're familiar with Rx operators `debounce` and `throttle` are good examples of Rx features that can't be modeled with transducers (nor should they be) You could but please don't :p Doing any sort of communication in the handlers given to `maketransducer` will cause problems (I'm not sure _what_ problems but there will definitely be problems) does it work like `mapping` where it just alternates between consuming and emitting?,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Define a constant ANGLE of value 120. Now design a function pinetree that takes two numbers a and d as input and returns the image of a simplistic holiday tree (lateseason as that may be) as follows. The tree consists of 5 upwardpointing isosceles triangles (of color green obviouslyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½forestgreen is nise and is a valid BSL color) stacked on top of each other. The top triangleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s equallength sides have length a and are joined at an angle of ANGLE degrees. For the triangle below that the equallength side length increases to a+d and so forth with the bottom triangle having equallength side length a+4d. The angle does not change. The stack of triangles sits on top of a brown rectangle of width a and height 1.5a depicting the trunk of the tree. Design a simple bouncingball animation. The animation should take place in a 300x300 scene with white background. A small ball (a black circle of radius 5) is initially located at position (0,150). The ball should now move straight southeast until it hits the bottom edge of the scene. At this time it should bounce off the edge toward the northeast until it hits the right edge of the frame (which will happen at position (300,150)). At this point the ball should turn red and stay at position (300,150) for the rest of the animation (as far as the viewer is concerned this ends the animation).To achieve this define constants for the scene and two samesize balls one black and one red. For the animation you need to define a single function drawball that takes the xcoordinate of the ball (a natural number) as input and draws the ball at the correct position (x,y); you do the math to figure out y. Like pinetree this function returns an image. Remember that for some values of x the ball moves southeast; for others it moves northeast. The origin of the coordinate system is the topleft corner! The color of the ball also depends on x.Once you have defined drawball to start the animation you pass the function name to the animate function: (animate drawball). For this to work your code must include the (require 2htdp/universe) directive (in addition to (require 2htdp/image)). @everyone Did you ask your instructor for help? @Gix Please don't ping everyone to ask for help and please ask for help in the #help channel (which I just created for this) sorry my bad! and yep I asked the TA but he didn;t know what to do",,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Is that still a thing? I believe it is definitely on the cards. But it important to remember that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lispï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Racket wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t go away and it has had multiple major changes including splitting away from scheme because it is a language engineering platform. You can still run the code from The Little Schemer HTDP 1st Ed. or SICP. The rhombusbrainstorming github repository is where it is being worked through https://github.com/racket/rhombusbrainstorming/blob/master/resources/goals.md It\'s less racket2 won\'t be a lisp and more there\'s going to be a new language you can choose to use instead of racket just like how you can choose to use typed racket instead of normal racket and it definitely has nothing to do with investors or anything like that A new language on racket is more like changing your boots. Contrast that to almost any other language (C++ Python Perl) where it is more like open heart surgery. Plus the core team are massive ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Lispheadsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(M Flatt admitted to this live on stage) Hahaha yeah for sure. I was looking into C++ Schemes to put on top of Unreal 4 and the set up for the ones I looked at are all a real nightmare.Well that's all good to hear then (And they build languages like I collect stamps!  the main dist comes with Algol68!) Hahaha That does seem pretty unnecessary that's hilarious What about Chez? https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!msg/racketdev/2BV3ElyfF8Y/4RSd3XbECAAJ Chez did actually look the best and possibly Bigloo. Guile Scheme was the one that I really didn't like the looks of. In the end I didn't need to implement one at all M Flatt is building a new racket backend on Chez Ah that's interesting! What did you end up using instead I'd still kind of want to go through the process of implementing one of those at some point but somebody implemented Python into Unreal 4 and it's crazy mature. I just threw Hy on top of it and it's been working amazingly totally unrelated: today I am sad because `(transduce somevector #:into intolist)` is about _two thousand times slower_ than `(vector>list somevector)` ?ï¿½ï¿½ (for context see here https://github.com/jackfirth/rebellion/issues/351#issuecomment564909375) Hahaha that's rough Atomichron docs available! https://docs.racketlang.org/atomichron/index.html?q=atomichron @notjack it is frustrating because the transducer protocol is actually a nicely elegant way to generalize the streaming problem. @oaktownsam agreed. Step 1 is write a bunch of benchmarks I guess. @oaktownsam how do you feel about the srfi 171 transducers? Me neither except I keep running into the person implementing them. Both on Reddit and the mailing list. yes he monitors the reddit and pops up whenever I post transducers news. Said he was working on a racket port. That tends to result from having lots of very largescale codebases and a community of people who do lots of refactoring of legacy code ```(struct left (value) #:transparent)(struct right (value) #:transparent)(define (eithercase either lefthandler righthandler) (match either [(left v) (lefthandler v)] [(right v) (righthandler v)]))``` that's how I usually do it as part of advent of code day 6 I made a graph API for Racket:```(provide (contractout [graph? predicate/c] [emptygraph emptygraph?] [emptygraph? predicate/c] [nonemptygraph? predicate/c] [graphvertices (> graph? set?)] [graphedges (> graph? multidict?)] [graphinsertvertex (> graph? any/c graph?)] [graphinsertvertices (> graph?

So here's an idea Rust/C++/C/etc. can avoid a lot of work done by GC'd langs by passing around data structures on the stack rather than the heap especially when those structures don't have complex lifetimes What if `rebellion/type` could fake stack allocation using Racket\'s multiple return values? So if you had a `point` type with an `x` and a `y` field and a `distance` function accepting two points you could call that function like this:```(distance [point p1] [point p2])```...and that would actually be short for passing the fields directly like this:```(define p1.x p1.y p2.x p2.y)``` and somehow combine that with a `point` constructor that doesn't actually construct a point but instead just returns the two fields as two separate return values I'm gonna sleep on that thought,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,,,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I want to do transformation from pollen markup/markdown to html on the clientside. thank you for information on current state of `js` compilers. Wasm backend seems very interesting I don't know your constraints but I'd suggest having a web based editor with compiling happening on a server being much more achievable and would provide a stepping stone towards doing it all on the client. yeah it's already done with `pollenrock` and it rocks ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I didn't know about that  can you share the link? https://docs.racketlang.org/pollenrock/index.html There is a deep difficulty in the fact that pollen is dsl for a racket and it seems that it's not so easy to compile to js/wasm. There is need to add some parts of the racket interpreter to js code ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but there is a real profit of doing this because fully clientside pollen webeditor would be much cooler and it would be possible to add multiuser collaboration on the level of source editor > and it would be possible to add multiuser collaboration on the level of source editor@kilomeow that could be added to pollenrock. I think multiuser collaboration is harder sansserver  I think there have been some projects to do it (not in racket) Two people editing the same document onscreen at the same time probably also has disadvantages. (It certainly has technical challenges) Can I suggest an alternative? Set up a github action that compiles a pollen repository on commits. oh that's cool idea I can't recall one. would be fun. 2htdp/universe & 2htdp/image or a console version!,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,*opinion,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's easy to read and gives you a sense of idiomatic use of recursion over lists. > Different problems are better solved different ways. Looping has its place recursion has its place. But both are important and it\'s good to know when to use which@nixin72 Could you please expand on this? My only substantial programming experience so far is with _How to Design Programs_ which I am very close to finishing. The book introduces for loops in an intermezzo but otherwise sticks to recursion; and in looking ahead to the contents of the _How to Design Classes_ draft I saw that it contains a section called Why Loops are Bad ... but that was never even started. While I have had no problem with recursion in working through _HtDP_ when I was trying to implement 3SUM based on an algorithms textbook I did think using nested for loops looked easier. Why does there appear to be hostility to for loops in functional contexts?,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Any products you use? Curious this is a good litmus test as to whether a language ecosystem has prod users who aren't in the research space lol but i am actually curiouys there is definitely logging infrastructure available within the language the log receiver functionality is enough to implement configurable logging to stderr and syslog oh yeah for sure I think I've heard of people hooking it up to log storage services before but clients for commercial log products the ones that let you track and do ci to measure occurances etc ya maybe check the package catalog for packages that implement clients to cloud logging services? presumably if there any then their authors had a use for them and you could ask them how it went or google racketeers who've published their tech stack i'm digging around atm let me know if you find anyone I'm curious ?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ oh baby https://pkgs.racketlang.org/package/racketdogstatsd,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,*opinion,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It should return a number indicating where in the sentence that word can be found. If the word isn't in the sentence return #f. If the word appears more than once return the location of the first appearance.> (location me (you never give me your money))4> (location i (you never give me your money))#f> (location the (the fork and the spoon))1``` the issue I am facing is that the false case does not work due to the recursion being (+ 1 (+ 1 (+ 1 #f))) how can break out of the recursion and return false? How about checking whether the recursive call's result is `#f` or a number before adding 1 to it? the part where you have `(+ 1 (location small (bf big)))`  the `(location small (bf big))` expression could be a number or false so you should only add 1 to it if it's not false @nixin72 The developer of Koyo Bogdan is on the racket slack  ask him (he is a really nice guy I met him briefly in Berlin).
